Seahearn4,"No the intersection is poorly designed Theres a Yield sign but also a dedicated lane for the runupmerge At some point you have to go to get traffic moving And the travelling lane should be aware of the oncoming traffic merging in and allow space The cop was baiting the cars behind him in a fundraising effort

Its like sitting at a red light thats malfunctioning How long do you wait before you cautiously overrule the malfunctioning red light The answer is probably somewhere between 2 minutes and an hourbut closer to 2 minutes",2023-11-09 14:20:59,430,554
Global_Lock_2049,"Theres a Yield sign but also a dedicated lane for the runupmerge

There isnt Its just a wider lane until it breaks off into another right turn only lane There is no merge lane unless you cut people off

Source I live here This is Bethlehem Township in PA near the William Penn Park  Ride

Edit this is the way traffic works there during rush hour ever business day I used to park at that park and ride The cop acted like every other person does when the light is red for the exit ramp off of 78 33 Not sure why i said 78",2023-11-09 15:03:54,246,551
Rokee44,"wow theres the real oh moment I also assumed it was a right side merge lane at first glance and was thinking in line with what seahearn is saying

It being an exiting lane means the yield sign is doing precisely its job here telling mergers to wait and yield to traffic in the middle lane as thats where theyre going Sucks for those merging on and exiting right but the road was obviously designed to prioritize main throughway and exiting Mergers can queue for their turn safely there no big deal 

You probably also get a ton of people cutting up the right side then causing backups as they try to force their way in or worse have to come to a stop trying to merge on while essentially on an exit ramp idiots

funny situation of something looking stupid at first glance or out of perspective but actually just functioning exactly as intended and people are just impatient af",2023-11-09 15:24:45,59,898
ObeseVegetable,"Fun fact theyd still have to yield to oncoming traffic even if they wanted to continue on and take a right as the oncoming traffic was given the right of way to that lane as well 

See a lot of near accidents on an intersection near an onramp to a highway for this reason too",2023-11-09 17:31:31,13,283
Nagisan," Fun fact theyd still have to yield to oncoming traffic even if they wanted to continue on and take a right as the oncoming traffic was given the right of way to that lane as well  

That doesnt sound right to meif the cars in the oncoming lane are maintaining their lane because theyre turning right then the cars that have to change lanes should need to yield to them as in cars maintaining their lane takes precedence over cars changing lanes",2023-11-09 22:30:20,3,462
ObeseVegetable,Youd be correct if there wasnt a yield sign there,2023-11-09 22:32:19,1,52
Nagisan,Theres no traffic to yield to if the lane youre in is open in front of you with no cars turning into the lane,2023-11-09 22:39:32,3,112
ObeseVegetable,"Correct 

But if traffic wanted into that lane the traffic with the yield sign yields",2023-11-09 22:44:17,0,90
Nagisan,Exactly my point thoughif they wanted into that lane As in you dont yield from the yield sign side when there are no cars in the lane or attempting to enter the lane such as is happening in a majority of this video where no cars are entering the lane with the yield sign,2023-11-09 22:53:31,2,280
ObeseVegetable,"With the amount of people who dont use turn signals ever its just safer

Heck even the cop in that video wasnt using his properly",2023-11-09 22:56:47,1,137
Rokee44,Yeah exactly Even if someone from that road were to shift into the right lane only to then realise it was ending and go back to the middle With that yield sign theyd still have the right of way to do that People are brushing off the sign but it means the mergers are at fault if there is an accident and you dont move into a lane unless youre 100 noone is intending to use it Looks like its a bit of a hard judge in this case even without the traffic,2023-11-09 23:39:52,1,463
ObeseVegetable,"With yield signs pretty much the only time the person with the yield sign wouldnt be at fault is if the other person is speeding to an extreme degree

A lot of people dont realize that either",2023-11-10 00:44:32,2,198
NWVoS,"People just dont like to wait 

I turn into a lane just like that exit laneright turn lanemerge lane every day for work The exit has a yield sign for right turns and a red light for people going left The yield leads to a right turn lane at a light only 50ft down the street only So most people are merging into the center or left lane I turn right maybe 25ft from the yield sign and people who just drive into the right turn lane ignoreing the yeild cut me off forcing me to slow to a crawl to make my turn Almost every time the people cutting me off then move into the center lane

There is also a similar situation at my exit going home The exit is much larger and has 4 lanes total one left turn one straight and two right turns The farthest right turn lane leads to a force right turn 100ft down the road And people need to make that turn So if a car treats that lane as a merge lane they are fucking over all the people driving through the exit light and making their own right turn

Either way some people are jerks and impatient",2023-11-09 20:44:29,2,1060
Rokee44,This stuff happens all the time people really are whacko Thats where I come from when Im saying anyone not thinking the black car is in the right here either has never driven a car before or are in fact an impatient asshole driver themselves lol Because anyone else who has to sit through the mayhem of a daily commute is so used to exactly the situation in OPs vid this wouldnt even be a discussion or a popular post for that matter,2023-11-09 23:51:21,1,440
RidiculousIncarnate,"I wish I had a picture on hand to show people what an actual runupmerge lane looks like because I take one every day on my commute Its a long merge lane from a suburban side street and a lighted intersection where the speed limit is 40 then onto a two lane highway with a speed limit of 55 Unless there is heavy snowice there is NO REASON to come to a complete stop when you take the turn you have more than enough space to get up to 5055 choose an entry and merge at speed And STILL we get people who come to a dead stop and wait for a break in traffic or the light to change when theyre staring at like 250ft of merge space

Whats pictured in the OP is NOT that This is actually a spot where you need to stop and yield if traffic is moving

These are the same geniuses who will barge into traffic from this kind of turn and grind the shoulder while malding because other people arent making space for them

Your comment is irrelevant to the fact that anyone and especially a cop STILL needs to signal if they wish to move over The turn signal also isnt JUST for the lane he is turning into it is ALSO for the cars behind him so people behind him can prepare for their maneuver That being said you see some guy waiting in the middle of the road for no reason with no blinker you are just going to assume hes a fuckin idiot not that he is trying to turn left because well there is literally zero indicators that he is turning left He forgot to use those Which is illegal  
SO he commits an illegal maneuver to block traffic stopped in the middle of a right hand turn lane and obstructing traffic without the use of any sort of hazard indicators or turning indicators and then thinks its okay to pull someone over for going around what appears to be a broken down car more or less   


What crime exactly was committed by going around this cop Perhaps the guy wanted the right lane and so well he got into the right lane Whats the problem its an empty ass right lane with an idiot blocking it eventually someone is going to do the RIGHT thing and facilitate the traffic flow There was no risk or hazard in going around the cop car the cop just got embarrassed about his shattered ego and had to pull him over to save face A normal cop wouldnt have given a fuck",2023-11-09 16:29:53,-1,1618

Youre right its a dedicated lane but as others pointed out its an exiting lane for the main road probably is usually a bunch of traffic that turns right up at the intersection so youre supposed to merge directly into the middle lane there to do that obviously some waiting may be involved In high traffic areas there are queuing lanes engineered into the design Becomes less about keeping cars flowing and more about safely idling them around in the most efficient way possible to avoid creating larger problems anyone that plays city builder sims probably knows about this lol the merging traffic is just a lower priority So the cop was just doing exactly what theyre supposed to do in this scenario Furtermore if there was any confusion by the drivers behind as to why the white SUV wasnt going yet theres a MASSIVE sign right there explaining the situation this shouldnt need to be said but PSA to drivers out there if there is a yield sign its probably there for good reason and if someone is being slow and you cant see why just stare at the red and white triangle and hypnotize yourself if you have to Do whatever just chill and dont be black car guy

as an aside it always baffles me when impatient aholes have to force their way as far forward as possible just to be stopped by the traffic immediately in front of them happens so often and half the time you cruise right on by them when the lane they cut around you to get into ends up with more traffic in it so weird A loooot of people out there thinking their lives are important enough that a minute here or there makes a lick of difference in a commute",2023-11-09 15:49:30,5,1725

plasticcitycentral,Where do you see the yield sign It really looks like just a typical merge cop should get up to speed there will be enough space and someone should provide extra once it is clear the cop intends to merge,2023-11-09 14:31:57,1,207
frameratedrop,"On the right side of the video Its the white triangular thing with red trim that says Yield

Youre supposed to wait where the cop is and use the lane to get up to speed to merge once an opportunity presents itself

Its raining too so the wait will be longer when merging 

I used to work at a salvage auto auction and Im sure a nonzero number of cars came to us because the driver didnt know how to yield

Also merge signs in the US dont say the word merge they show two roads combining into one road Thats how you know theyre supposed to yield Its like confusing a Stop sign with a Roundabout sign They mean different things use different colors and are different shapes",2023-11-09 16:00:38,5,706

truth_tuga,"Oh its not for merging Hmm What is it for then 

Most of these comments including yours fully explain why North Americans are brutal drivers That cop is 100 in the wrong for impeding the flow of traffic 

The yield sign applies when traffic from all directions is moving In this case you still move forward until the end of the merging lane and zipper merge keeping the flow of traffic moving albeit slow

frameratedrop,"Thats literally not how youre supposed to do it

Wow you guys dont understand anything do you This is the process for making a right turn at a yield sign with a terminating merging lane

1 Slow down or stop at the yield sign to check for a clear path If there are any obstructions you wait until it is clear for you to proceed The cop wasnt as far as he could have been but hes 10 ft behind where he should be and youre saying he should be 500 ft past it  

2 When the lane you are merging into is clear you proceed down your terminating merging lane so that you can be at speed when entering the roadway  

3 Merge


Thats it Its raining too so if anything the merging process should take longer Wet roads are slick if its an area where it doesnt rain much then theres a lot of oil that builds up on the roadway when it actually does rain and its even more dangerous to try and startstop more suddenly

Its rich that youre expounding on how the case would get thrown out of court when you dont know what the traffic laws are for merging If you dont stop and yield before trying to merge the cop would be perfectly Im the right to give you a citation 

Lastly its a cop so of course their a douchebag Youre just being redundant That doesnt mean it would get thrown out of court They dont believe us over cops and unless you knew the guy recording youd have 0 evidence to counter what the cop said anyways

The definition of a yield sign is indeed wait until potentially hazardous traffic has passed ITT people who need to be told not to be so overly righteous You certainly shouldnt be stopping at the beginning of the merge lane when you can proceed safely Thats not inn the letter it the spirit of the law Add backing up is against the law

WerkingAvatar,No thats a red yield which means that you have no right to the lane and must only proceed if the lane is clear and theres an opening else you must stop   A yellow yield implies that you can merge in with caution while giving way to the other lanes occupants as they still have right of way  A lot of people dont understand the difference,2023-11-09 13:30:04,48,346

And uh No thats fucking wrong as hell you yield at the sign You dont fail to yield so you can cut in to traffic and yield 30 feet down the way The sign is where it is for a reason

This is a merging lane into an existing lane they can not zipper in this situation Zipper lanes are used for where one parallel line ends and another continues not where a perpendicular lane turns in with another Because that requires this setup for safe traffic control

tratata1973,Uhm I would like to point out the cop was actually entrapping  He is sitting at a yield sign he needed to have moved like 40 minutes before the video started,2023-11-09 11:07:36,-28,161

KungFuAndCoffee,"2 of the 3 car accidents Ive been in were where I foolishly stopped at a yield sign to wait for a break in on coming traffic The first said she thought I had already gone and was only watching the oncoming traffic The second one told the cop who responded to the scene she was going zero miles per hour when she hit me 

I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the wiring in the brains of people who dont understand the concept of yielding to oncoming traffic Im pretty sure they think yellow means FLOOR IT",2023-11-09 11:31:48,9,535

tratata1973,Buddy  Buddy bud  Friend  Thats not how yield sings work  You dont yield to the people in other lanes that have nothing to do with yours  You yield to people in your lane by letting them into your lane  If nobody is in your lane you proceed forward  You dont run into other cars in the left lane  You drive forward align yourself with a gap and merge in   Cars arent supposed leave gaps for you to merge in  You find gaps thats what the onramp is for  And yield doesnt mean stop,2023-11-09 11:21:56,-23,501
OneBayLeaf,Wow So why the yield sign,2023-11-09 11:37:41,8,27
tratata1973,So that people yield to outgoing traffic  Yield does not mean wait for someone to let you in  It means yield to other traffic as you drive,2023-11-09 11:41:21,-14,141
OneBayLeaf,Maybe its time for a quick internet search Im still unsure what you think yield actually means You seem to say just drive like normal and merge which is incorrect If that was the case there would be no sign at all Yield means to come to a stop if need be,2023-11-09 11:46:15,11,261
SmokeyDBear,Naw mate clearly yield is just an archaic form of yeet It means send it and make your own gap,2023-11-09 12:01:04,7,102
tratata1973,Yield means exiting traffic has right of way  You stop if there are cars coming into your lane  You dont need to stop for a yield sign if there is nobody in front of you and there is no one to yield to  If there was no yield sign you wouldnt have to let anyone in it would be on exiting traffic to find a gap the way you are finding a gap to merge on so its not the same  This is very very simple and uncomplicated,2023-11-09 11:57:00,-2,424

Round-Version5280,"That is an acceleration lane and is never very long When he has space to merge over then he is to use that lane to match traffic speed and merge over If he doesnt have a space to jump in then he needs to wait for that opportunity It is the fault of traffic that they arent leaving safe distance to the next vehicle which would allow merging but its also wet out so the following distance should be greater

Based on your other replies you have a backwards idea of what merge actually means and confirms why people entering traffic go bumper to bumper and force traffic to come to a halt so they can enter theyre expecting traffic to yield to them when the yield sign is actually for the people trying to enter traffic",2023-11-09 13:12:12,1,729
tratata1973,"Idk what you are even arguing about  Its very clear from the angle of the vehicle that the cop is not waiting to merge  He is waiting there because he is trying to go across all lanes to the leftmost one  The rest of what you said is nonsense  If traffic in the right most lane of a not so busy highway is somehow so bumper to bumper that you cant merge then you eventually have to come to a stop somewhere along the ramp  Thats not supposed to be the most unsafe place you can possibly imagine  the beginning of a curve where your mirrors have no visibility and most of the incoming traffic is in your blind spot its supposed to be a last resort if you cant merge

Round-Version5280,"Based on your reply you definitely did not understand a word I wrote because you tried to slap down something I didnt say

I get some frequenter if the area might feel different Perhaps that particular driver is also frequent and knows you can safely proceed Perhaps the driver was new  Either way that looks like a poor design for the scenario described  Sets everyone up for frustrationfailure  If youre truly supposed to wait for the light to clear traffic there should ve another light indicating such otherwise you just gotta wait for thr person in front ans hope they arent on their phone or broken down  which is usually the reason i see people stopped and not moving  Eventually people honk or drive around",2023-11-09 19:28:08,1,746
Global_Lock_2049,"You really cant safely proceed though The camera is skewing it a lot Theyre driving over the shoulder not only to pass but they also are driving through it to proceed forward Like the cop also has to basically drove illegally to follow My guess is the person wanted to take the park and ride exit and not have to wait for traffic Sort of like when someone drives the shoulder in traffic on a highway to reach their exit

This exit ramp is like this every single rush hour Everyone is able to figure it out

Edit why does there need to be another light Once traffic stops they can proceed regardless of the light Thats why the right turn has its own lane They arent beholden to the light but it does guarantee them the chance to go when theres traffic But at 11pm at night theres no need to wait for the light

Edit keep in mind everyone here would have seen the cop drive up to that point Theres no reason to believe they suddenly broke down If the light changes and they dont go Sure But the person in the video is cleslry stating the cop cant join that lane of traffic yet As someone from the area I can confirm the person taking the video simply has working eyes",2023-11-09 19:41:29,3,1206

Xpqp,"Even better than car videos are motorcycle videos The comment section is always either extremely pro motorcyclist or anti motorcyclist and the video is almost irrelevant The same video posted in the same subreddit on different days could have comment sections that blame the motorcyclist for breaking the law claim that what he was doing was entirely legal and is therefore acceptable regardless of safety conditions claim that even though he was legally correct what he was doing was unsafe and therefore he should die or claim that even though what he was doing was correct and safe it was acceptable for a car to ram him because motorcycles suck

ColinHalter,For sure Luckily this one goes into its own lane so theres no need to stopyield The confusion comes in because of the yield signs for the roundabout entry diagramhttpsimgurcomaPcpQJm3 Because the entry has a yield sign on both sides and because local drivers are evolved from Raccoons they see a yield sign on their right and assume its for them even when it makes no sense to stop there,2023-11-09 20:12:42,2,411
a009763,I might be misunderstanding but the way Im used to roundabouts is that you need to wait for whoever is in the roundabout and they will go on the outer lane if they are turning off on what will be your right in this diagram So if anyone to just go straight right without stopping they would then be blocking the path of anyone coming from the roundabout and turning off to the same road,2023-11-09 23:11:32,1,388
ColinHalter,The slip lane in this case goes into its own lane not a shared lane with the roundabout If it were a shared lane on the roundabout exit then yes the slip would have to yield Im that case though it would be pointless as the slip lane exists to relieve roundabout traffic and keep people looking to essentially turn right out of the roundabout Because it has its own lane on the exit road the roundabout and the slip lane can safely have cars exit at the same time without the need for a yield,2023-11-10 00:23:20,2,501

BonnieMcMurray," To build onto this the cop may have needed to get into the far left lane

Look closer the turn lane goes into its own lane Theres no reason for that yield sign to be there So if the cop wanted to get into the far left lane the correct thing to do would be to keep driving into that lane parallel with the other travel lanes and indicate left

I remember being taught not to pull up directly to the crosswalk at a light  basically you should be able to see the first line over your cars hood Except every other fucking intersection has the magnetic detectors built right up to the crosswalk forcing you to be closer 

When its a dedicated leftturn lane if youre not over the magnet or whatever it is youll just never get a green light

We have one big left lane around here that has two detectors and Im almost positive that when someones on the first and I stay back on the second we get a faster cycle

Rokee44,"im sorry youre missing it Your logic is sound when thinking that is a merge lane but it isnt and thats why theres a yield sign not a merge sign

the lane you are referring to is a right hand EXIT lane for the road they are merging onto there are also multiple signs explaining that which are not quite visible in the video look ahead and youll see an intersection immediately after this merge area and theres a dying right hand exit only lane

Without the yield sign sure that lane could be dual purpose for merging and exiting but you can see how that could cause worse traffic issues

Hence the yield sign

lol everyones all dismissing the sign like its a guideline and not the point here but it literally has all the information youd need to understand this situation and is 100 a traffic violation to not abide by said sign

plus those puppies cost like 20000 to put up trust me daddy wants his xmas bonus they aint tossing those things up all willy nilly lol if they are there they are for good reason follow the signs people

also I get that cutting onto a shoulder to turn right is pretty common and not exactly reckless per say if youre chill about it still illegal and bad move but plenty of cops wouldnt do anything about it but black car guy was a dick about it so fk around and find out lol",2023-11-09 16:35:43,0,1351

When the cop pulls the asshole over in the shoulder he certainly had enough room to merge and give space No accident was caused by both cars 

Everyone sucks at that intersection at that time 

Theres tons of local intersections in the US like this where the flow of traffic gets impeded when someone opts for the more cautious approach In my neck of the woods you do that sometimes the oncoming traffic will have someone who stops to let you in which they shouldnt do which becomes equally dangerous Without knowing more its hard to know how much of an ass the cop was and totally agree the shoulder driver is an ass and an accident waiting to happen",2023-11-09 12:07:01,-11,1034

Kicken," They would have to cross a solid white line to merge from where they are 

Well thats the thing This isnt really a merge lane Merge lanes indicate that other traffic has to yield just as much as you do  both work together to make it happen Yield indicates that other drivers shouldnt change anything and you just have to enter where there is space without changing traffic I know drivers often dont pay any mind to this but that is what the signs mean And so the cop would simply start driving straight ahead and change lanes once there is no traffic to impede",2023-11-09 08:37:05,22,580
Dazzling-Kale-4491,So why did the cop instantly step on the gas with enough space to pull over the vehicle that passed them A yield in this manner is almost always safer when you keep an idle roll instead of a complete stop 50 feet before the turn lane ends Almost like they couldve kept a slow roll to merge into traffic but didnt because they were likely being an asshole as most cops do Cops can tailgate anyone and everyone which we know is not safe but as soon as you honk at them they get all uppity and pull you over,2023-11-09 08:50:27,14,510
Disbfjskf,"The cop never left the yield lane  he just pulled forward to the end of it to pull over the shoulder guy

For merging considerations you can merge with the smallest gap if you match the speed of incoming traffic So its better to leave however much space you need to fully get up to speed so that once you spot an opening you can use your lane to match traffic and then merge without losing space to acceleration If you just keep rolling forward youll eventually lose the option to match traffics speed and youll need to wait for increasingly large gaps to be able to both merge and match traffics speed before the next vehicle arrives",2023-11-09 15:08:31,2,649

Newhollow,"uFormal_Management974 uVestigial_joint uafrothunder1987 uSnoo43335 and you are clearly forming opinions based on another video or bias

Start of video Their is honking as both vehicles cop and recorder inch forward We do not know how long but they are moving slowly 

He might have had a point as the post tittle suggests Honking is to ensure safe operation of motor vehicle In an emergency it can be used to caution or warn Honking is not free speech or show road rage

uScubaCam meant the offending vehicle reason to pass on right violation 
A solid white line at the side of the roadway means drivers are not permitted to cross that line to go around someone turning left from the highway or roadway

Person after 1 honk ask who is beeping Recorder states traffic is expletive Cop stops at 3 seconds as honking goes to emergency level honking

It seems the vehicle in front of cop just merged and they were inching too slowly for vehicle behind recorder Still they need to yield or wait for opening In low visibility conditions you are meant to slow not speed up Unless you are merging with traffic as cop was doing as lead vehicle

In this case law is on cops side He may have just pulled over vehicle to give them a stern warning Ticket for offense is not unreasonable Besides seeing if they were impaired or had other violations",2023-11-09 10:13:10,0,1388

Lets take the whole merge thing out of the equation If you were driving in the right hand lane of a three lane road and wanted to move left into the middle lane do you come to a complete stop in the right lane until its clear to merge left Surely you have to yield to traffic on your left so does yielding mean coming to a stop in your lane until there is a gap",2023-11-09 15:55:15,1,953

anengineerandacat,"Its not a dedicated merge lane take a good hard look at the line markers on the left and notice how it goes from a solid white line to an open lane

A dedicated merge lane would have a solid white line on the left lane with a dashed line next to it on the right indicating only traffic coming onto the other traffic can pass through often with merge text on the road itself

That being said looks like plenty of room for the cop to have just zipper merged in and traffic isnt moving that aggressively but thats honestly on their discretion whether they stop or not

Ultimately though the only vehicle with the right that can pass that cop is the dash cam guy with existing road rules can just easily claim he thought the cops car was broken down and he was bypassing an impediment

The car behind him or possibly several cars behind him honestly has no idea what was going on he just was being a jackass and blew past everyone even moreso because lets assume an animal or something was passing in front of the cop car at the yield zero visibility

  slow down

  be ready to stop and yield the rightofway at the intersection

  check for other vehicles pedestrians and bicyclists in all directions

  let any vehicle bikes or pedestrian pass before you proceed

Rightofway is yielded until the lane is clear I used to live near one of these off 75th street in NE Seattle that puts you onto the I5 SB and the entire reason the lane has the continued rightofway was because it was fed by a oneway artery with lights Roosevelt Way NE which creates gridlock if backed up The lights always make huge gaps so there is never meaningful back up on the yielded road You just sit and wait to go join the traffic on the highway so just chill my god

mofohank,And Id agree with you completely in those cases But in this one the yield sign is specifically telling drivers not to treat this as a normal merge So if you dont see a problem with the signage and instead blame the drivers for not ignoring it it makes me question your judgement on this,2023-11-09 10:10:15,7,292

I never said that using a merge lane is violating the yield sign My point is that like your said you yield every time you merge anyway so the yield sign in this instance is utterly pointless

So sorry if I seem argumentative but I can only see 2 options Either a the yield sign is actually performing a function here that youre not aware of or more likely b youre right that its completely superfluous but you dont understand why this would cause confusion and unnecessary caution",2023-11-09 11:24:22,3,727

afrothunder1987,"Someone else by the way said that the yield sign means one at a time instead of a zipper merge

Thats absolutely not what a yield sign means And a yield sign doesnt mean a zipper merge either A Merge sign means a zipper merge where the responsibility for the merge is on both lanes not just one 

A yield sign means you are responsible for safely merging and giving way to the traffic in the lane you are merging into If any accident happens while merging its the yielders fault Often this means you need to come to a compete stop When there is a merge lane which is specifically designed to facilitate merging while moving thats exactly what you are supposed to do merge while moving The longer the merge lane the more idiotic it is to stop and wait 

This is an example of a pretty long merge lane and the cop is an idiot The cop is not technically wrong but spirit of the traffic rules is to facilitate safe and efficient movement and hes definitely wrong in that regard",2023-11-09 16:51:44,1,1004

However where I live basement dwellers are the ones who dont know that yield signs are merely suggestions here and actually yielding will result in a bad time for you  Yield signs are more like you better pick up some speed if you want to merge

So Im waiting there with my left turn signal on happens all the time in high traffic and this truck coming the other way wants to turn left We both would have to wait for traffic but instead of pull into the turn lane in front of me facing the opposite direction and wait for me to turn into my building before he can then safely pull forward to where my car was wait to turn left onto his street he tries to drive past me and nudge around me But theres not enough space for him to get fully into the turn lane and turn into his street and I cant pull forward any more otherwise I cant get into my parking Again hidden drive narrow entry 

So this guy trying to go around behind me has his truck bed sticking out into the lane of cars that Im waiting for halting them to a stop and no one left space for me to turn but they also cant move because this guys blocking the lane now The guy in the truck also cant make his left turn because theres traffic coming the other way as well So he decides the thing to do is roll down his window stick his upper torso out of it not exaggerating and start shouting at me to move I just think Where do you think can I go You blocked traffic so that I cant turn from this lane

Eventually his traffic abated and he turned to his street allowing the traffic I was waiting for to move so that I could turn into my apartment Some people are impatient Some people are idiots Some people are both",2023-11-09 17:02:43,6,1997

majormoron747,That lane probably ends in like 50 ft so he would have to merge soon after plstarting to roll and traffic looks thick so rather than try to force his way in he was just trying to wait for an opening Just not in a rush I guess he could have gone but it would e been like a matter of seconds before an opening showed up and they could just pull in without having to try to zipper,2023-11-09 10:35:29,1,384

We can not see the rest of the road There could be curves There could be hills It is definitely raining 

There could have been a fair amount of wrecks at this location which would prompt the sign 

This is why they test for this when we get our licenses Yield signs are not merge signs

Kicken,That would be the case if there was a merge sign rather than a yield sign Zipper merging typically relies on other cars to slow slightly to allow your entry But a yield sign indicates that they do not need to do that If you collide with another car because they do not slow down for you it would be your fault due to the yield sign If there was a merge sign then it would be their responsibility as well,2023-11-09 08:43:14,203,418
beaud101,"This is 100 correct on a yield which directs the traffic wanting to join If you dont feel there is room to mergeyou stop Period If you merge and an accident ensuesyou will always be liable Nobody has to let you in

Since it was a yeild it was just an acceleration lane to allow a yielding car to be able to match traffic speed Youre not merging two lanes you are just entering

siggias,"In my country europe there are no mergeyield signs The car that is moving into the lane is always at fault if there is a collision so I guess everywhere works like a yield sign if I understand you correctly

If a car stopped like that over here he would def get some angry horns You should continue on the lane so you can merge at speed Merging from a standstill is often impossible due to constant traffic

Kicken,No clue how EU law works but in the way you describe if its always the merging traffic needing to yield right of way their fault if a collision happens then certainly in some cases traffic has to stop since they have no right of way,2023-11-09 08:59:02,28,241
siggias,"If traffic is moving like in the video there are usually gaps between cars If you are also moving you can slide into one of the gaps without issue But if you stop then you might have to wait a long time before you can merge

NLwino,"Let me say first I would agree with you normally I live in the EU and that is how the laws are here But the video is not in the EU and there is a yield sign here

Since yield means yield Traffic already on the highway has priority here they do not have to make room for oncoming traffic wanting to enter the highway Thats why the cop stops at the START of the merge lane So that when there is actual room he can pick up speed and merge without slowing down traffic on the highway Worst thing that can happen is that you have to stop at the end of an merge lane

I know one spot in the Netherlands that does it on a similar way But instead of an yield sign they place a traffic light at the start of the merge lane Allowing only two cars at a time to enter the high way

The gaps between cars that you see here in this video are not for allowing cars to merge They are to keep an safe distance If you force yourself into such space with a car the car behind you has to break to get a safe distance again and so do you slowing down traffic on the highway",2023-11-09 09:59:36,34,1080
luftwebel,"they do not have to make room for oncoming traffic wanting to enter the highway

That is also the case in Europe Still merging and esp total traffic flow is a lot better when both parties involved move

instead of an yield sign they place a traffic light at the start of the merge lane Allowing only two cars at a time to enter the high way

Thats purely to moderate the traffic influx onto the highway Usually happens on exits that could easily overload the regular highway traffic otherwise Basically the jam is kept in the cityroad while the highway remains moving at least somewhat

The gaps between cars that you see here in this video are not for allowing cars to merge They are to keep an safe distance If you force yourself into such space with a car the car behind you has to break to get a safe distance again and so do you slowing down traffic on the highway

siggias,"Yes that is right If you are unable to merge you will need to stop at the end of the lane But this rarely happens since someone usually gives the merging car a little space

cynric42,"Ive seen plenty of yield signs in Germany at the start of a slip lane So yes it is your responsibility to merge safely but if you treat it as a stop sign youll get some angry honks from behind Usually there are enough gaps so you can slip in after using the slip lane to match speed to traffic

However in Germany there is usually a more cooperative attitude in driving although it has gotten worse in recent years If someone is accelerating on the slip lane it is common courtesy to not intentionally close the gap and instead maybe lift the gas a little to make it easier for them",2023-11-09 12:42:28,-6,597
_GLAD0S_,"That is not really correct tho and is probably different in many countries around europe

As an example we have a road and on the left another road that merges into yours On the beginning of the merge there is a give way sign for you meaning that you have to give the others right of way when trying to merge failing to do so is generally your fault   


While there is no specific sign for merge or yield there is the option of give way to indicate who has the right of way in a specific situation   


If you try to merge generally others have right of way if no sign is present so in the case of high traffic you might have to actually come to a stand still at the end of the merging area It can happen At which point you can just hope for someone to slow down to indicate that you can merge safely   


But regarding the video here The cop doesnt use his indicators comes to a stop at a honestly rather random position and doesnt really look like he would be actually trying to merge  
So i kinda suspect he stopped as he suspected already that the car would do this from previous behaviour we cannot see   
He probably just baited him into doing something illegal",2023-11-09 12:21:28,6,1196

The_Singularious,"Yield  Stop until all traffic is cleared Can be dangerous in some situations to stop and go 

Hard to say whether they should have merged but zipper merging at speed on a yield is the fastest and safest approach They definitely had opportunity to do this and did not

rotate64,The white line ends where the cop is stopped that whole section of road is one lane you cant just drive on the side of a car in its lane because the road is wider in that section Someone else said it because a right hand turn off up ahead but at the section the cop is stopped because 1 single lane and is not an on ramp,2023-11-09 19:31:44,2,326
The_Singularious,Wasnt saying to drive on the side of another car It appeared they couldve easily matched speed here But gotcha on the on ramp I thought it was an on ramp and my statements were all based on that assumption Sounds as if I was soundly incorrect,2023-11-09 19:36:16,0,249

dan_cole,Theres clearly a yield sign  cop was following the traffic rules,2023-11-09 11:35:17,14,67
Sillybanana7,Technically but when there is so much traffic you will never merge in because there will never be a break The proper procedure is to go into the dedicated lane you have and try to merge in front of someone almost everyone unless theyre a raging maniac will have no problem letting you in Everyones driving like 5mph,2023-11-09 12:49:55,-8,323
L7ryAGheFF,The yield sign makes it not a dedicated lane for you Traffic already on the highway has the right of way to move into that lane likely for an exit further down the road and you have to yield to them,2023-11-09 13:29:03,9,202
BonnieMcMurray,It is a dedicated lane not a mergehttpsibbcoS5qqKSC The yield sign means If a vehicle moves from the left lane into your lane let it go first As you can see no vehicles in this clip are doing that so theres nothing for the cop to yield to and therefore no reason for them to sit there like that,2023-11-09 18:40:00,2,314
rotate64,You added that line that doesnt exist the lane the cop is in stops where that white line stops and that yield sign is placed It becomes 1 lane plenty of roads like this where I live please learn for this That is the other cars lane its wide but still his lane,2023-11-09 19:48:04,1,270

Bitdream200K,I dont live in the USA can someone explain why the cop didnt drive The lane is completely free If he has to turn left why doesnt he have his turn signal on I dont see any point in him standing in the middle of the road,2023-11-09 08:41:01,25,227
Necessary_Disk,The yield sign means that basically a car must wait until there is a break in traffic to proceed and merge The vehicle must stop at the yield sign when there is not a break in traffic The empty lane in front of the vehicle is used to accelerate into the break in traffic safely If there is no traffic the vehicle doesnt need to stop and can continue into the free lane and merge onto the road,2023-11-09 09:49:28,37,398
Bitdream200K,"And way didnt the cop use the lane to merge He basically stops 10m before even allowed to change the lane due to the solid line and also no turn signals are on For me the cop just stay at place without doing anything or showing what he want to do 


Thanks for your explanation",2023-11-09 09:55:02,8,288
Necessary_Disk,He didnt merge because there is traffic The yield sign means the oncoming  vehicles have the right of way so they do not need to slow or let you in The merge lane is used to accelerate If the cop moved down the merge lane without any break in traffic they would have to stop at the end of the lane and merge into traffic from a stand still which is dangerous and it would be more difficult to see oncoming vehicles In this instance the lane is to get up to speed to safely change lanes not to zipper into traffic The cop had to stop due to the yield sign As for not signalling perhaps they would have turned on the signal when they began to actually change lanes or perhaps they werent going to use it even though they should,2023-11-09 10:03:51,46,740

Sillybanana7,The lane is used to accelerate when there is no traffic there is obviously a lot of traffic and everyone is moving very slowly at 10mph There is nowhere to accelerate you just go into acceleration lane and slowly merge a lot of cars who are not raging bone heads will let you merge in I know I would The cop is clearly baiting must be end of the month and he hasnt reached ticket quota,2023-11-09 12:46:05,-1,393
HLSparta,"There is nowhere to accelerate you just go into acceleration lane and slowly merge a lot of cars who are not raging bone heads will let you merge in I know I would

And if the cars dont let him in then what happens",2023-11-09 14:09:27,3,224
Sillybanana7,You wait until someone does but if hes so far away and not trying then no one will stop obviously cause theyll be blocking cars behind them,2023-11-09 14:19:01,-3,142
HLSparta,The thing is hes at a yield sign and hes not supposed to use the merging lane until theres room to merge into traffic If he were to go and nobody would let him in then he either has to force his way in potentially causing an accident or he has to come to a stop at the end of the merge lane In that case he would have a much harder time seeing and would have no room to accelerate before entering the lane,2023-11-09 14:38:16,2,414
tomxkas,From the footage there were many situations where the cop couldve merged into the traffic if only was he up to speed That being said American drivers are often clueless when it comes to driver etiquette From my POW cop is an Ahole here and blocking traffic flow,2023-11-09 10:31:02,-12,269
Shrek1982,Something I havent seen mentioned yet cop cars generally have a lot of shit in between the passenger area and the driver area eg cage wall that can impede your ability to see which might be why he chose to stop further back and keep a more square angle with traffic,2023-11-09 14:16:07,1,271
mercTanko,Canadian here but my driving instructor got annoyed with me for not speeding up in the yeild lane and respect other drivers speeds for a smooth merge She would have hated this cop lol,2023-11-09 12:35:49,2,185
pureeviljester,"OK and if there is no space to merge the yield lane is irrelevant 

Wait at the sign and when you see a long enough gap use the lane to speed up and merge You dont just use the lane and force a merge thats not the point of a yield sign",2023-11-09 14:07:51,4,246
BonnieMcMurray," The yield sign means that basically a car must wait until there is a break in traffic to proceed and merge

blinkincontest,yeah and a 30 mph speed limit sign means never go over 30 mph but nobody bats an eye about it ACTUALLY meaning 30ish just like this means yieldish,2023-11-09 13:48:26,-3,149
DaveAndJojo,Ive lived in Chicago suburbs and a college town Ive never seen a yield sign like this   Guarantee you that people would merge in Chicagoor each car in line would be yielding for 5 minutes,2023-11-09 13:04:32,2,194
chadwicke619,The preponderance of drivers in this post will tell you the cop was simply yielding and was completely correct Its true that there is a yield sign but a huge huge percentage of us would just continue along the short merge lane and carefully zipper into traffic I can see plenty of big gaps in the video where a combination of movement and a blinker would have made it easy to get in Some people will say the cop is being safe but plenty of others would describe this as overly cautious Personally theres no way I sit there like the cop  Ill keep moving turn on my blinker and safely squeeze in  no problem Notice how the filmer immediately pulls right out And how the guy who skips the line and the cop who chase him have no problem zipping right along,2023-11-09 15:31:47,2,772

BonnieMcMurray,"There are two possible reasons why the cop isnt going forward theyre an idiot who doesnt understand what that yield sign means or else theyre sitting there deliberately hoping that someone does what the impatient driver did so they can write a ticket

As you say the lane in front is completely free So if no vehicles are moving from the left lane to the one the cop is in  and they arent  theres no reason to stop there",2023-11-09 18:47:55,1,438
rotate64,See how the solid white line on left stops on side of the cop And yield is on his right The traffic moving in front him it becomes their lane Its wide then normal because ahead it splits again into a right hand turn But at that point it is one lane and no lines separating it You cant just drive into it because its wide enough to fit both cars,2023-11-09 19:51:01,1,354
bbbbbbbbMMbbbbbbbb,"1 It looks like there is an entire lane to use for merging If that is the case the cop is a dick and fishing for someone to pull over 

2 To maintain traffic flow you should use all lanes available and practice zipper merging This is a situation that requires both parties to participate in Those trying to merge and those in the lane that is being merged into 

3 Aggressively driving around is dangerous and ultimately could generate more traffic should something go wrong

Mr_MM_4U,Something some people dont realize is sometimes with these big SUVs its hard to accelerate into traffic from stop And when you have traffic and others coming into your lane and not slowing down it becomes dangerous I went from a small sedan to a mid size suv and I notice this problem when merging into highway via ramps I can imagine the full size SUVs like this suburban being more problematic,2023-11-09 12:04:30,11,403
Affectionate-Heat-51,Thats why there is an acceleration lane,2023-11-09 15:52:47,2,40
Mr_MM_4U,You can see from the video theres no acceleration lane just that lane and a yield sign Looks like this single lane is used to enter the highway and also to take an exit Thats probably why it has a yield sign so motorists would stop there and yield to any vehicles changing lanes to take the exit  Im just going by my experience and the video ,2023-11-09 16:04:35,2,351
BonnieMcMurray," Thats probably why it has a yield sign so motorists would stop there and yield to any vehicles changing lanes to take the exit

Thats correct you yield to any vehicles moving from the left lane into your lane If there are no vehicles doing that you drive forward No vehicles were doing that so the cop should not have been sitting there",2023-11-09 18:52:50,-1,348

Yield allows you to proceed without stopping ONLY IF you can proceed safely 

But if theres oncoming traffic that requires you to stop as in this video where the recorder says traffic is like so fucking bad shitty and you can see the weather is bad so an experienced driver knows to be extra cautiouseveryone has worse visibility and stopping distance then yield means you have to stop

SnollyG,"So you think the police officer stopped for an unnecessarily long time

Were you there

Because the police officer was there and the police officer obviously judged it too dangerous to nudge forward 

And the person recording was there and he noted in words how bad traffic was 

And we can see in the video that the weather was bad

We can also see the amount of traffic and relative speed of traffic

Pedantic_Phoenix,Yes i believe what i said i believe yup Of course i cannot be sure As you cannot be sure either But to me my idea is much more likely Its simple really Also by the way the fact that you say the weather is bad when its barely raining if even tells me you are a terrible driver which is probably also why you are projecting that on to me And also also standing still without going is dangerous in itself just as much as saying fuck it and going just to address that point as well,2023-11-09 14:12:49,0,496
SnollyG," the weather is bad when its barely raining

As an experienced driver you should know that stopping distance is poorer when the road is wet

You should also know that you have no idea what the visibility is like for other drivers in passing cars Maybe their wipers are bad Maybe their windows are slightly fogged 

And so you should know not to rely on other drivers avoiding you when you nudge into traffic

For those who arent aware what the cop did here was a traffic infraction in itself Maybe even 2  


Lets start with the maybe if he was truly trying to merge he was attempting to merge without signalling very illegal We call it a maybe because it require mind reading powers since well he doesnt have his blinker on  


But now the actual crime it is illegal to just stop your car in the middle of a lane and block traffic IF he is trying to turn or merge and that is why he is stopped he NEEDS a blinker   
IF his vehicle is malfunctioning and he CANT move his vehicle he NEEDS his hazard lights on  


To be stopped in the middle of a lane with zero indicators of why you are doing so is an illegal obstruction of traffic   


This cop obstructed traffic most likely purposefully and then proceeded to pull anyone over who tried to solve the problem he created It was baiting at the minimum and entrapment at the maximum",2023-11-09 16:41:37,1,1262

No what is embarrassing is you appealing to the law as an absolute and refusing to reconise nuance

ironocy,But yield means stop until there is a half mile gap between cars otherwise how could you safely proceed What if an F1 race car suddenly appears from 34 miles away I dont know about you but I dont live my life a quarter mile at a time and neither does that cop They live theirs like theyre driving Miss Daisy,2023-11-09 12:37:06,-2,315

The point is this pathetic cop needs to hit the fucking gas pedal Get some goddamn balls people and hit gaps you see in traffic I know its all tulips and daisies in your precious little princess mind but you are NOT the only one on the road So youre just going to come to a complete stop on a yield Even way far back like that He couldve scooted WAY UP in that line and even hit so many of those gaps its not even funny I mean he took off faster than all those cars in that line to catch the guy at the end right Its a proven fact we all see it in the video So he couldnt hit the fucking gas pedal and hit one of those big ass gaps I see plenty of Get the fuck out of here 

He is being an entitled prick because he heard someone honking I see it daily Oh you want to honk at me Then we can wait in this line even longer You see him slowly moving in that big ass yield lane and then just stomps on his break after the honking starts he was 100 being malicious here Turn your signal on and move up the yield lane and hit a gap when you see one Its really is not that hard plenty of gaps for him to hit Especially when you see him go from a dead stop to passing up multiple cars he couldve merged in front of Pathetic",2023-11-09 15:11:48,-1,1764

BetterCallSal,It was at an intersection The cop was at a red light,2023-11-09 17:11:19,1,54
TarnishedVictory," It was at an intersection The cop was at a red light

There is no indication in this video that its an intersection Theres no markings on the ground that would indicate an intersection and in fact the markings on the ground indicate that its a simple merge What are you seeing that makes you think its an intersection",2023-11-09 17:21:34,0,332
BetterCallSal,Im sorry I thought you were asking about my story,2023-11-09 17:34:53,1,51
TarnishedVictory," Im sorry I thought you were asking about my story

Are you saying your story is fiction",2023-11-09 19:28:36,0,94
BetterCallSal,"Huh  What are you on about

You asked why I thought the cop was sitting there Since you replied to my story I assumed you were asking why the cop in my story was sitting there Thats because he was at a red light 

You then started talking about the cop in this video not being at a light or intersection So you were asking about the cop in the video Not the cop in my story So I clarified that",2023-11-09 19:49:01,1,407
BetterCallSal,As far as the cop in this video its a merge onto a highway and theres a yield sign The yield sign means dont go until other traffic has passed you So it looks like hes yielding to other traffic,2023-11-09 19:09:50,1,203
TarnishedVictory,"Yield is not the same as stop I didnt see any need for the cop to stop Perhaps I dont yield properly I didnt see any need to stop there as theres plenty of room to merge into traffic 

To me this looks like someone who doesnt know how to merge or is stopped on purpose to bait someone The only other likely explanation is that Im always merging wrong by actually driving forward while slowly getting over into a space in the traffic",2023-11-09 19:37:31,0,446
BetterCallSal,"Yield isnt the same as stop Youre right A stop sign you stop and wait your turn to go A yield sign you will never have right of way over other traffic You have to yield to it So considering theres a ton of traffic still in that lane hed have to merge into hes yielding to them

Edit not all merge lanes have yield signs This one does",2023-11-09 19:43:21,1,350

TarnishedVictory," DIVINE JUSTICE

This confuses me on several fronts First what do you mean by divine Are you suggesting a god was involved 
Second how is this justice It seems to me the cop was baiting people to go around him Do you think people shouldnt try to go around a broken down vehicle Do you think this kind of baiting is justice",2023-11-09 16:56:19,1,337

TarnishedVictory,Well now I feel like an idiot just slightly,2023-11-09 17:09:34,1,47
t105,There could be argument to made that the fact the civilian SUV sat for at least 10 seconds not moving could be viewed as a mechanical issue Hypothetically if this was the case at some point cars behind would need to go around 10 seconds with zero inching forward and plenty of room on the right isnt entirely unreasonable,2023-11-09 16:32:46,1,327

caspernicium,"That there is what I call a hard yield not to be confused with a soft yield even though they are marked by the same exact signs

Baffles me why there arent two different signs for when you have a merging lane and when you dont Instead of just an ambiguous Yield",2023-11-09 23:56:41,1,276

Techmite,Sorry to say for all you cop haters out there but Im almost certain that the cop saw the car in his right side mirror and was waiting for him to pass so he could pull him over the sudden stop was probably his realization of the crime in progress I think its illigal to stop when merging so having the benefit of the doubt for the police officer I would assume he was trying to abide by the law,2023-11-10 06:53:36,1,402
