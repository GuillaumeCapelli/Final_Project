One of the primary traits of a good developer is a strong desire for excellence If a developer is willing to settle for a mediocre and boring design then that is some perhaps small evidence that the book may contain mediocre and boring contentpAnecdotally At the TechWeek Chicago job fair there was a very high correlation between booths with good logos and graphic design and interesting people behind the booth All of my good conversations were with people at the well designed boothspEDIT This is especially true since we are expected to pay for the book before we get access to it This means that we cannot judge its quality in any holistic way but must do our best to prejudge its quality through various social signals,semiel,2013-07-16 21:07:12+00:00,0,742
After feeling very down so much that I didnx27t felt like myself I started to experiment with herbal supplements Valerian to sleep but my problem wasnx27t lack of sleep St Johnx27s Wort for mood but I didnx27t feel moodypI tried 5htp which from my understanding is a precursor to the biosynthesis of Serotonin The effect was immediate I felt light headed buzzed even I felt as if I had suddenly woken up in a bright new world I went groceries shopping could barely keep myself from gaping at all the colours products and people The next day those effects were gone but I felt fine Simply fine I tried to take more 5htp but those strong effects are gone I am no brain scientist but to me this is anecdotal evidence that I was very much lacking in Serotonin and that this herbal supplement boosted me right back uppItx27s not magical I still feel anxious about deadlines and stressed about hard to deal with clients However some kind of dark blurry veil has been lifted from my perception of lifepEdit Since then I increased my weekly physical activities and improved my overall eating habits I canx27t say if itx27s directly linked with my increase or rather closer to normal Serotonin but my instinct says yes,Raphmedia,2016-01-26 15:03:03+00:00,0,1270
First you asserted that it was wrong for Party B your wife to suffer because Party A a thief took her laptop It was unclear whether you were only trying to point out that opportunism isnt always moral or if you were also making the allegation that what the OP had initially done in this case was immoral which it is now clear you were not I was simply comparing the morality of Twitter in this case to the morality of the OPpSecond the position I attributed to you was a natural extension of your argument if you dont qualify such a statement as part of a discussion Im going to assume you are applying your suggestion to the discussion as a whole In this case you brought up that opportunism is not always moral which is true but you did not exclude the discussion at hand so I made the assumption that you were implying that the OPs stance was immoral as wellpThird please tell me how you expected you fail at reading comprehension to lead to any sort of rational debate before you accuse me of the same When you say such things without qualification dont be surprised if you get called an asshole because under the circumstances its likely true,jamiequint,2008-12-20 06:22:55+00:00,0,1178

The nice thing about Torque and an OBDII dongle is the fact that it can help you diagnose those quotrandomquot issues that only happen occasionallypYou set up Torque into logging mode clear your codes turn on the GPS and mapping and drive away When your car does quotthat thingquot take a note of the time then when you get home go back thru the logs around that time mark and take a look at all the sensor data plus any thrown codes If you know your car and understand what is going on it can help you to narrow down the diagnosispWhile a regular code reader or getting the codes read will help you by giving you the codes being able to get the codes timestamped in a log along with sensor data can go much farther in telling you where a particular problem liespWhile there are other code readers out there that will do this logging and tracking too they typically cost hundreds or thousands of dollars  well out of the price range of most home mechanicspThere are many other things that Torque can do or be used for for instance virtual gauges are a nice feature  you can set up an Android tablet with a cluster of them giving you much more feedback than you can get from your regular dash instrument cluster and itx27s cheaper and easier than setting up a bunch of physical gauges on a stock vehicle,cr0sh,2017-07-07 16:34:00+00:00,0,1349

Thats true but in many cases of undefined behavior compilers take the liberty of interpreting it as an assertion In this case for example its legal for the compiler to assume that p and q dont alias when it sees this expression because either 1 they really dont alias in which case the assumption and subsequent optimization is correct or 2 they really do alias but in that case the behavior is undefined so the compilers choice to apply erroneous optimizations is not prohibitedpIts a common approach in C compilers for inferring more optimizationrelevant semantics than the language constructs explicitly specify,mjn,2012-07-25 13:29:42+00:00,0,640

I spent some more time thinking about this and wrote the followingpModern scientists move small amounts of biological materials using a tool called the pipette  Pipettes can work with very small amounts of liquid down the microliter  When youx27re running a delicate experiment being able to deliver the precise amount of liquid is criticalpPipettes need to be calibrated  How do you calibrate a device that works with volumes of liquid  Volumes of liquid are hard to measure  Fortunately water at STP standard temp and pressure has a known mass so you attempt to draw 1 mL and weigh it  1 mL of water weighs 1 gram at STP this is not a coincidence itx27s by definitionpOK so youx27re weighing 1 gram of water and adjusting the pipettex27s calibrator knob so that 1mL on the pipette weighs 1 grampI guess that means your weighing scale needs to be calibrated too  Huh  These sorts of scales arenx27t just quotweigh some flour for bakingquot either  They have to be accurate to the hundredth of a gram and have walls to avoid fluctuations due to air currents and minor temp changes  The scales are calibrated using calibrated test weightspOh dear  Calibrated test weights  If you follow the turtles ialli the way down you find that there is actually a tracebility chain from your calibrated scale back to one of the defined weights held by NIST the NIST equivalents in France and Japan they all share their weights  So you can actually calculate using those weird rules of error propagation you forget in high school the error of your scale as a product of the errors in that chain often knowing your error bars is more important than knowing the accurate answerpBut thatx27s not all  Those defined weights  Theyx27re obsolete  Le Grand K the origin of the kilogram still kept under lock and key changed weight over time due to subtle metallurigcal detailspThe new definition of the standard is created by an obscure machine at NIST just like the time standards  a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fenwikipediaorgx2Fwikix2FKibble_balance relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fenwikipediaorgx2Fwikix2FKibble_balancea is the tool used to do it and it depends on the NIST time referencepSo turtles all the way down until you get the rubidium fountain,dekhn,2021-02-04 18:40:05+00:00,0,2357

The two biggest competitors to Byte Buddy today are javassist and cglib Both of them work quite differentlypjavassist takes strings containing Java code and compiles these strings at runtime This makes it simple to use as every Java developer knows Java Unfortunately the javassist compiler lags a lot behind the actual javac compiler For example it does not support generics or even autoboxing not to speak of lambda expressions Also Strings are not typesafe what makes javassist code quite error prone It is the equivalent of concenating SQL strings together with all the risks like foreign code injectionpcglib allows you to register callbacks for an overridden class similar to the JDK proxies However this requires that all class loaders know about cglib if they want to know these cglibproxies as cglibspecific types are hardcoded into any generated class Also cglib only allows subclassing but not the rewrital of existing classes Furthermore the callbacks require any arguments to be boxed and registeres these boxed values into arrays It turns out that cglib is not quite JustInTimecompiler friendlypByte Buddy works with annotations or its typesafe DSL and realizes its instrumentation mostly based on delegating to user code This way you can implement interceptors in any JVM language and you avoid dependencies on Byte Buddy within the generated classes annotations are fortunately ignored by JVM class loaders if they cannot be resolved at loadtime This makes for example for better exception stack traces than when using quotstring codequot Also Byte Buddy avoids boxing by creating smarter objects for the interceptors and only creates those interceptors that are requested by annotated arguments using dependency injectionpASM or BCEL are rather byte code parser than code generation libraries You need to have a clear concept of how byte code works in order to use them Also those libraries allow you to create quotunverified codequot ie you have to do a lot manually Byte Buddy is itself built on top of ASM you can even plug ASM code into Byte Buddy if you need to,raphw,2015-03-04 14:29:52+00:00,0,2151

Id isolate literature from this though Literature has always been a medium with a limited audience In the past due to most people being illiterate compared to modern times where it isnt accessible to many people due to literary complexitypThe last 100 or so years has been an anomaly in that for the first time in history we had a highly literate population that could read fiction And for much of this era movies and TV were not as accessible to create or consume But today it is both affordable to create distribute and consume fiction via the motion picture therefore making written fiction niche as the audience for it isnt interested in the literary aspect of it so much as the story telling element So as weve had cumulatively more content disseminated at at accelerating pace it has made most written fiction as obsolete as the parlor singer or traveling news reader Implanting the stories would do to TV what TV has done popular bookspMay be it time or effort modern story dissemination technology allows people to consume more fiction per hour I only think most people werent reading because they liked to read They wanted to consume stories and now fiction books are just not able to compete with TV streaming But literature should be continue on as it has,nemo44x,2021-05-11 03:19:58+00:00,0,1290

Preparation Could everyone come prepared with the state of their workpIn my experience the preparation part is the part most likely to fail Either the meeting planner isnt the type of personality to enforce it or the meetings arent important enough for the participants to actually do the prep In either case you can drop it as just having a clear goal and agenda will make any meeting betterpAlso forcing yourself to be clear about the goals and the agenda will help you see ways that you could eliminate parts of your meetings",tonystubblebine,2008-06-23 02:57:34+00:00,0,1197

How to get over shynessp1 Take up some kind of partner dancing as a hobby eg salsa swing etc  It doesnt matter as long as it looks like fun  This will force you to connect with people and push your comfort limitsp2 Start going to social dances after you know a few moves  Usually the class teacher will be able to tell you where you can dance socially  This will get you in the habit of asking women for dancesp3 To make friends you need to invite people to do things away from the place you know them from  So if you meet someone you seem to get along with say something like Hey Im thinking of going to see this movie this weekend  You interested  Since youve been asking women to dance this should be much easier by this timepAnd dont think you wont meet programmers dancing  I once asked my teacher once why so many of the regular guy dancers were programmers or accountants  She said that it wasnt just limited to my city but all over the world programmers and accountants make up a disproportionate amount of the male dancers,mattm,2011-07-07 05:39:54+00:00,0,1072

Resisting the kneejerk urge to rewrite a piece of software from scratch is something that has taken me a while to master Im much more levelheaded about it now I try to think through whether or not there is a legitimate reason for the rewrite Sometimes that reason certainly exists but Ive found more often than not that doing so is overkill Its a lesson that has certainly saved me a lot of time since and allows me to focus on more important tasks,epenn,2011-04-18 20:15:33+00:00,0,458

"While superb logistics are not unique to Amazon it is just one factor that combined with other mostly nonunique factors creates a very unique and hard to duplicate advantagep1 The marketplace  Amazons website are massive marketplaces with tons of sellers millions of customers tons of reviews etc
2 Third party seller network  Amazon has thousands of people that sell on its site  This results in lower prices more selection and more money for Amazon when they take their cut
3 Fulfillment  Yes Amazon has logistics but it also has Fulfillment by Amazon  Third party sellers can send Amazon their inventory  Amazon charges them rent for this  Plus Amazon does not have to take inventory risk on that item yet it is still available to customers within 24 hours  And to top it off Amazon still gets their cut of the salepAnd the one ring to bind them all

iThis is often asserted but is it true Most alarmism that I have seen is coming from the media or activist organizations the few times Ive seen scientist alarm has been when recent measurements have been worse in some way than their models predictipOn the broad level of course its true  The rise of global warming alarmism over the past three decades has enormously increased the level of funding for research and turned the original scientists into kingpins who get to play on the world stage  This doesnt necessarily mean that they are biased by the money and power but it does mean you should treat grant funded scientists with the same level of skepticism that you would treat Exxon funded scientists that is if there actually were Exxon funded scientists unfortunately the defense has decided to not show up the casepiThis is often asserted but is it true Most alarmism that I have seen is coming from the media or activist organizations the few times Ive seen scientist alarm has been when recent measurements have been worse in some way than their models predictipThe typical modus operandi is that every time a climate scientist finds a shred of evidence that confirms their view they run to the NYTimes with dire warnings  But every time their is evidence going the other way they either hide it  a hrefhttpwwweastangliaemailscomemailsphpeid34538filename1059664704txt

the layman reading only the NYTimes keeps hearing that recent measurements have been worse than predicted despite that there are dozens of other data points going the other waypiFurther lets assume the funding relationship is true Are all these scientists that dishonest Wouldnt honest ones be reigning in their colleagues Why havent we seen thisipFirst they are not completely dishonest  It is not a conspiracy  It is a scientific theocracy  They are true believers  But if history shows anything priesthoods are very common even among smart well meaning peoplepAnd yes there are dissenters For instance a bunch of scientists criticized the IPCC reports saying Finally while the IPCC enlists many expert reviewers no indication is given as to whether they disagreed with some or all of the material they reviewed In previous IPCC reports many expert reviewers have lodged serious objections only to find that while their objections are ignored they are acknowledged in the final document giving the impression that they endorsed the views expressed therein and produced their own summary report  Read it here a hrefhttpwwwuoguelphcarmckitriresearchispmhtml relnofollowhttpwwwuoguelphcarmckitriresearchispmhtmlapBut because the priesthood controls the peer review and grant process most of the dissenters are either tenured professors like Richard Lindzen or completely independent people like Steve McIntyrepOccaissionally you will get someone on the inside to write something very brave But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now editors reviewers and authors of alternative studies analysis interpretationseven based on the same data we have at our disposal have been bullied and subtly blackmailed In this atmosphere Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the politically correct picture Some or many issues about climate change are still not well known Policy

appalled that they are doing soipWell its not supposed to be their job  Their job is to present a full and balanced view its the job of policy makers to make the policypBut of course thats not the case  My real problem is that newspapers and people like you still treat these scientists as unbiased experts rather than as expert witnesses for the prosecution  Listen to what they say but dont treat the fact that there is a consensus as evidence that they are right  Of course all the expert witnesses for the prosecution are going to be of the same mindpiSure So does astrophysics evolutionary biology  How is the situation different from any other deep specialityipThe advantage other sciences have is that their theories can be proven or disproven on a short time scale  Either your rocket works or it doesnt  Your medicine either kills people or saves them  Thus you have independent verification and falsifiabilitypThe area of sciences that are not subject to these forces tend to diverge from reality very quickly see macroeconomics string theory most nutrition research etcpiSo all we hear about is a consensus when that consensus is really just a selfreplicating group of believersipThere is no shortcut other than to either look closely at the science yourself or else find individuals that you really trust and follow their opinionpI havent looked deeply into the actual science  But the amount I have looked into it raises an enormous number of questions  For a laymans summary of the main issues with the science read the report above and read thesepa

"TCPx2FIP is the common name for the Internet Protocol Suite which UDP is part of
Also since many mobile clients tend to issue requests over TCP due to it being more reliable over mobile and that many responses can be larger than 512 bytes now and EDNS is not really a standard DNS over TCP will probably over take UDP quite quicklypThe text below is from the RFC and no it does not relates to zone transfers but to normal DNS queries pprecode   All generalpurpose DNS implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP
   transport

   o  Authoritative server implementations MUST support TCP so that they
      do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP
      packet

   o  Recursive server or forwarder implementations MUST support TCP
      so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCPcapable
      server from reaching its TCPcapable clients

   o  Stub resolver implementations eg an operating systemx27s DNS
      resolution library MUST support TCP since to do otherwise would
      limit their interoperability with their own clients and with
      upstream servers

   Stub resolver implementations MAY omit support for TCP when
   specifically designed for deployment in restricted environments where
   truncation can never occur or where truncated DNS responses are
   acceptable
codepre
And for the most important part Ppprecode   Regarding the choice of when to use UDP or TCP Section 6132 of
   RFC 1123 also says

       a DNS resolver or server that is sending a nonzonetransfer
      query MUST send a UDP query first

   That requirement is hereby relaxed  A resolver SHOULD send a UDP
   query first but MAY elect to send a TCP query instead if it has good
   reason to expect the response would be truncated if it were sent over
   UDP with or without EDNS0 or for other operational reasons in
   particular if it already has an open TCP connection to the servercodepre",dogma1138,2014-12-27 16:39:40+00:00,0,1990

The only exception to this is when a reddit admin actively modified a thread by users being hostile This creates irreparable problems because users canx27t trust the administration to not tamper with their comments They have on record stated that they will not do this in the future but you canx27t undo the removal of trust of their users I have been a reddit user for almost 11 years and I am not associated of the group in question and it has made me loose faith in redditpTheir struggles with advertisement is something they can actively address now Before when they were smaller than digg once digg made a huge mister and alienated their users this allowed to flourish into the site it is today Due to the fear of what occurred to Digg their advertising was less aggressive their advertisements have been less aggressive and attempt to be targeted But since reddit is so large now the risk of alienation is much less Also other condenders like imgur and voat have tried to take the throne from reddit without success Also they have made great strides in making it accessible to everyone and you can get anyone from any political spectrum If reddit wants to make money they have to broaden their appeal greatly and I believe thats the purpose of the 150m Hopefully when they do this they wonx27t turn out like digg because they are a much larger network now",zitterbewegung,2017-06-17 02:46:51+00:00,0,1685

gtBut in the bank scenario the dollars that it loaned out arent worth any lesspJust a small point of clarification  I think  that helps to make your point a little clearerpIf the bank collapses  itx27s likely precisely because those loaned dollars ARE worth less  Commonly in bank collapses  those that borrowed from the bank canx27t repay for whatever reason  Creditors to the bank then get spooked and demand x27redemptionx27 of their deposits etcpThe difference is that whether or not a borrower from the bank still has that wealth is mostly independent of the actions of the bank making other risky loans that lead to collapse etc The value of the borrowed dollars depends entirely on the borrower Whereas with tether  you might have locked it down in a hardware wallet encased in cast iron steel under your bed  doing nothing risky with it at all  but it could still go to zero in value  Tetherx27s value depends on the actions of the issuer entirelypSimilarly  the owners of tether canx27t through their risky use of tether endanger the prospects of the issuer while borrowers can through their risky use of loans endanger the prospects of the banks,oraphalous,2021-10-16 17:35:51+00:00,0,1210

New reactors should reduce the waste produced per reactor andx2For offer ways reduce it In general Gen IV reactors produce far less waste per kWh There are some theoretical MSRs molten salt reactors that may even be used to reduce the radioactivity of existing waste All active nuclear power plants use LWRs light water reactors which need to be refueled every two years The quotspent rodsquot still have a significant amount of energy The best Gen IV reactors require one refuel every thirty years I believe with enough investment and research we will see more opportunities to not only reduce but reuse and recycle waste The real question is would you rather deal with waste confined to containers or waste that has been spewed into the environmentpThere are a lot of structural issues with the current fleet of reactors Partially because these reactors were built decades ago and have been used far past their designed lifespan We shouldnx27t equivocate the capability and issues of old nuclear with new nuclear technologypYes solar wind hydro and grid storage technology have the potential to support our power generation and distribution infrastructure However it isnx27t realistic to  expect this within the next couple of decades Although we see how investment into these sectors have helped accelerate the technology We should do the same for nuclear which is powerful proven and the only direct replacement for coal and oilwithout upgrading the infrastructure Give me 10 large Gen VI reactors and I can wipe a huge amount of carbon emission out of the mix Instead of waiting for all these small pieces to be developed organized and synchronized into a fully functioning gridpa hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fenwikipediaorgx2Fwikix2FList_of_commercial_nuclear_reactorsUnited_States relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fenwikipediaorgx2Fwikix2FList_of_commercial_nuclear_reaa,Meandering,2021-05-10 01:12:48+00:00,0,1954

My previous company built technology in this space based on Squid and some custom tools  I vividly recall competitors making bold outlandish claims like these on a monthly basis back then  None of them ever came to pass  They required too much infrastructure build out too much cooperation from ISPs and website owners and the companies behind them demanded too much involvement and too much money from all parties in the chain  There was a CDN rush back then too and only a few managed to raise enough money and build out fast enough to be successful at it  This kind of technology requires a build out similar to a CDN but with far more involvement of parties that are very unlikely to have an interest in being involvedpIve had long conversations with folks at Akamai Red Swoosh and many others in this particular areaand its astonishing how much money it takes to build this stuff out and finding profitable ways to build out small making it useful enough to make money on iwithouti first spending millions and signing on dozens of ISPs is very difficult I just dont think there is that much VC money floating around right now even if big giant if theyve actually figured out technology that works on the scale theyre promising,SwellJoe,2009-07-19 21:33:26+00:00,0,1272

My path to functional programming started with Paul Grahams lisp essays and books and then SICP and Scheme I visited the world of Haskell but only half heartedly as I was much happier in a dynamically typed world for my hobby projects As a daytime C coder I found types an annoyance so much time wasted getting something to compile Later I came to discover types again with Scala and now Im fully sold I will revisit Haskell again some day but most likely will learn Elm first Elm is a much friendlier ML style language and much more explicit about things like monads Moving from Elm to Haskell is much easier since the programmer will have aha moments mapping what they did explicitly in Elm to what you can do more generically with type classes in Haskell,justinhj,2017-10-16 14:59:44+00:00,0,770

"Different Coloring Agents 
Paints and inks have different coloring agents Paints are made up of tiny bits of colored minerals like clays or talc suspended in a colorless matrix such as polyester or vinyl A chemical union of tannic acid and iron sulfate dissolved in water or alcohol forms the coloring agent of some inks Others use such dyes as anilinepDifferent Coloring Procedures  
Ink soaks into the surface that it colors but paints do not soak in  they cover the surface with a coating In fact a primer is usually applied to the surface before painting so that the paint wont soak in For this reason paint sometimes chips off the surface that it covers but this never happens in the case of inkpSurface Protection

For most private schools and the more prestigious public schools the only people who pay list price are those most able to pay it Working class and even squarely middleclass kids will generally qualify for significant amounts of needbased financial aid in the forms of grants So to the degree that cost is a factor you should be considering the tuition in conjunction with the financial aid package offeredpI think neither cost as long as the cost is affordable nor prestige should be the top criteriapI think its more important to find a good match between the student and the environment of the college The most important aspects of the environment are the professors the other students and the available academic programspId discount big research universities since the foremost criteria used by the institution for evaluating undergrad instructors is 1 are they cheap ie grad students 2 does their research attract prestige funding and cheap labor ie grad students  The foremost criteria used by undegrads in evaluating their profs is coolness and the ease of getting a good grade  Also access by undergrads to profs is limited They are usually teach in big lecture environments and their office hours are limitedpFocus more on institutions like small liberal arts colleges that place a high value on undergrad instruction while still expecting profs to maintain a level of engagement in scholarship and research  The classroom environment is usually more intimate and profs are more available outside of the classroompThe students are important too Every hour spent with a prof will also be spent with other students Better they contribute to the experience  Also for every hour spent in a classroom setting there should be at least as many spent studying and socializing with other studentspEven if you have your criteria firm in your mind its hard to get enough information to base an evaluation on so it pays to look for points of leverage among friends family family doctor high school teachers etc  None of them are going to have good knowledge of more than one or two institutions but teachers will have a sense of the experiences of former students Older friends and relatives will know about their own institutions  Parents of friends and relatives will know something about the experience of their own children and also of the children of their own friends and family  Whats most important though is that these people will have an inside perspective not just the institutions but on the prospective student So tell these people what the student is looking for ask them for suggestions based on what they know and then ask them why they made the suggestion they did and see if it makes sensepIts also worth paying close attention to the way the schools markets themselves If a college manages to communicate a strong and consistent identity for itself in its marketing materials then id give that identity some weight unless their is strong evidence to the contrary particularly if the same message is delivered once theyve issued their acceptance  There are some perverse incentives for small schools to misrepresent themselves but these mostly come into play before applications are received  Also I think these perverse incentives are checked by the fact that they dont have a lot of flexibility with respect to class size  Too many students and their quality of teaching suffers  Too few and their finances suffer  In addition if its a bad match and the student drops out it can damage their reputation and hurt some of the metrics on which they are judged when it comes time for reaccreditationpTake advantage of the net to get more of an inside view on schools too  We used to have prospective students checking out our live journal group I think thats died off a bit but there are still groups on facebook and whatnot and the school should be able to put you in touch with current students and recent gradspIn the end though its great to do a campus visit particularly if you are choosing among just a handful of schools Arrange it with admissions  They may get you a room for a night in a dorm and theyll get you into classes and give you a campus tour Outside the formal activities take advantage of unscheduled time to talk to other studentspRegarding the academic program a lot of students end up graduating in something they might not even have known about when they entered and they may end up making a living doing a job that didnt even exist when they graduated  For these reasons I think its important to get a good solid liberal education with exposure to a variety of subjects and viewpoints no matter what major they choose and a grounding in the humanities so they have a perspective on the forces that have shaped society in the past and can apply that perspective to understanding present day changespLast thing I think the prospect of launching a startup after graduating was raised in another thread  I generally encourage people to keep their options open after graduation by not taking on too much debt  For a student who is planning on a pursuit like writing a book or starting a company where they can expect little or no income for a long stretch after graduation I think the goal should be graduating with no debt at all  In those cases cost could become a more important factor 10K in loans might not be decisive if one expects to have some sort of paying job after graduation but it could be the difference between having grocery money or going to bed hungry if you are planning on scraping by while trying to get a startup off the ground,easp,2009-01-10 22:57:06+00:00,0,5727

You would not be taxed for generated energy Imagine that the cost for you to buy one kWh is 20 cents Currently when you push power back into the grid you get 20 cents back from the power company The government makes this so However the power company actually only really needs to bill you about 46 cents depending on which one you ask The rest is taxation This means that after the government stops subsidising panels you would just get 46 cents back per kWhpOf course this makes the value proposition for moving power into the grid much worse but it changes precisely nothing for power that you use from your panels you are still getting 20 cents worth of power from a panel that has already been paid for by youpFor this reason it is best to rely on the subsidy as little as possible and maximise the power you use directly from the panel either by changing your habits or by storing the power for later in a battery Sadly using batteries adds additional costs to this picture and is not currently worth it at all even without subsidies,krageon,2019-08-13 12:56:17+00:00,0,1067

One of the challenges I face is on temperature The HVAC unit on our building was not really designed to do even temperature control of an open 60 x 100 space So we get warm and cold spots and adjusting one can screw up the others Ive done a bit of research on it and their are two challenges for our particular system one the number of mixers in the ceiling which can change air temperature and the way in which thermostats feed back into the systempI suspect if you sat down with Lennox or Crane and said we want to design an HVAC system that will work in this environment they would come up with something very different than what we currently have Sadly its going to take a bit to convince the landlord to rip out the old system and put in a new one,ChuckMcM,2013-05-25 19:15:38+00:00,0,767

During a lunar eclipse the surface temperature on the moon drops by about 150 to 250 degrees Celsius in a few minutes The whole quotdayquot side of the moonan immense region about seven million square miles in areais plunged into darkness For anyone on that half of the moon outdoors it would be impossible to miss one would not even have to look at the sky to see the sun being blotted out by the earth one could tell from the surrounding light and the temperature The moon is physically affected in a significant way Even if someone on the moon did not care about the earth they would care about the time of the lunar eclipse All this lines up somewhat at least matches the timeline with our apparent perception from earthpDuring a solar eclipse someone on the sun would hardly notice The surface temperature does not change the brightness does not change the earth is about a 100 million miles away and occupies less than 107 of the sunx27s sky 18 arc seconds compare with the 30 arc minutes that the sun or moon occupy in earthx27s sky An observer on the sun would need to have very good optical instruments to take note of the entire earth in the first place let alone the patch of earth a few miles across that is experiencing a total solar eclipse Unless they were looking for it they would not be aware of what the earthlings call a solar eclipse taking placepDuring a solar eclipse we people on the iearthi do notice The sun is hugely significant to the earth physically even though the earth is barely significant to the sun the temperature can fall by maybe 15 degrees Celsius people in the affected area of earth are plunged into darkness etcpAs a physically significant phenomenon whatx27s real during a solar eclipse in somewhat the same way as a lunar eclipse is happening on iearthi if we called it a terrestrial eclipse it would be fairly real but is the isuni significantly affected Ix27d say not reallyppNow as this is my last post there are a few philosophical issues this conversation has brought upp One is a question of ontology What is quotrealquot I think people can differ in the level of how physicalx2Fmaterial their ontology is certainly everyone would agree about a visual spectacle taking place but some would consider more quotphysicalquot phenomena more real as in my earlier remark about whether shadows are real and a brightnessandtemperature difference over half the entire moon is surely a physically more significant event to the moon than some faraway object casting a shadow on another faraway object would be to the sunp The second is a question of semantics What connotations does the word quoteclipsequot carry To some people it carries connotations eg quotXadj eclipsequotquotX experiencing a seizurequot such that for instance a quotsolar eclipsequotquotsun being darkenedquot is only appearance not reality while quotlunar eclipsequotquotmoon being darkenedquot is both appearance and realityp The third is a question of interpretationx2Fhermeneutics When I read something Ix27m trying to see quotIs there some interpretation under which what Ix27m reading is correctquot The question of quotIs there some interpretation under which the author of the above email is wrong and solar eclipses are similar to lunar eclipsesquot is not very interesting of course the answer is yes and in my earlier comments Ix27ve mentioned at least three interpretations under which the author is wrong Certainly itx27s not the language Ix27d use before reading the post Ix27d never have described lunar eclipses as real and solar eclipses as virtual and I probably still wonx27t Maintaining that the author is wrong does not challenge my perspective or contribute anything new to my life I feel secure in my understanding of eclipses and if someone has a different perspective it does not feel like my perspective is being questioned itx27s just an opportunity On the other hand quotIs there an interpretation under which the author is rightquot the principle of charity is more interesting and having newly experienced this perspective Ix27ve been defending an answer of quotyesquot yes not only is there a combination of connotations of quotsolar eclipsequot and quotrealquot under which a socalled solar eclipse is not a quotsolarlyquot significant event thus not quotrealquot in that sense but also itx27s quite a fresh way of looking at things and appreciating how even though both appear the same to us one which we call a quotsunseizurequot is an event of significance only to us puny humans on earth and the sun is unaffected while the other is truly improbably a case where the earth our home has an unmissable effect on the moon a case where our visual perception of the moon falling into shadow is actually correct something contrary to our perception being so frequently wrong in the astronomical domain where for instance the sun and moon and stars appear to rotate around us every day and night but reality is different,svat,2019-07-16 20:46:08+00:00,0,5252

My suggestions to mitigate this issue are as followsp1 Educate readers that it is not ok to harass your Authors or anyone really but I get that your job is to protect your peoplep2 Protect your authors through anonymity and teaching them good online habits  Pen names for younger authors is a great idea  Especially for first time authors who donx27t like the limelight and donx27t want to deal with the direct messages they will inevitably receive And if you have a first time author coach them on the kinds of responses they can expect  Some negative reviews will get through unless you go to anonymous so education has to be part of thatp3 Join in the fight against online harassment  I donx27t have any links but this is a problem and people need to know that bullying online isnx27t OKp4 Edit your posts  Grammar is much harder to make fun of if the mistakes arenx27t there  This is not a justification of others actions but a suggestion on how to avoid this specific type of bullyingp5 Be active in the HN comments and point out that specific comments arenx27t addressing content but instead just being nit picky  This could fall into the gratuitous negativity section of the HN guidelines but thatx27s kind of a stretchpEDIT The following are options but things you should not do  I tried to make that clear with the comments associated with these two options but I didnx27t make it clear enough  Donx27t do the following two unless you want to completely change your communityp6 This is optional but you can implement a login feature that requires people to link to facebook and then you can monitor your readers activity  It will loose you a ton of traffic but if itx27s really that important to you this is a way you can limit who can read your articles and thereby protect your authors  I donx27t think this is a good idea personally but it is an idea only you can decide to lock down your content like thatp7 Public shaming which IMO should be avoided at all costs but if someone is harassing someone else this can turn the tables  It also leads to witch hunting and perpetuates a whole different problem that should be avoided at all costspOnline communities have jerks  No matter where you go youx27ll find them  HN is no exception  This community does not ban people from reading articles or monitor itx27s users outside of this site so HN as an organization canx27t enforce this other than to spread the message and show people itx27s not OKpMy suggestion is try 15 for now and see how it goes,bargl,2016-09-30 17:49:09+00:00,0,2618

Copied from an HN user who said much better than I could 1 EDIT Ix27m now questioning is it appropriate to repost their words without their knowledge or consentpiHuman labor is not a commoditypThis was the common sense amongst all working people for most of the 20th century Samuel Gompers maybe the most conservative labor leader of his time said quotYou cannot weigh the human soul on the same scales as piece of porkquot And working people along with the management class for the most part understood this to be an undeniable truth In fact this piece of common sense was enshrined into US law with the Clayton Act of 1914 which stated quotThe labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commercequot But in the last 20 years as capital has gained the firm upper hand the common sense understanding has shifted towards the idea that labor is in fact a commoditypThe ideas behind the socalled quotondemand workforcequot further solidify the notion that labor is a commodity After all you can order an uber ride just as easily as you can order vitamins onlinepItx27s so pervasive that even I someone born into a union family and a firm believer in the idea of worker solidarity have to force myself to believe that labor is not a commodity Why The business class treated labor as expendable in 1915 just as they do in 2015 Why did working people understand this truth in 1915 but not today I donx27t knowpI read a recently released sociology book earlier this year going crazy looking for the titlex2Fauthor canx27t find it that posits millennials are far more likely than any recent generation to blame themselves for the problems they face Itx27s part of the reason that the selfhelp industry is bigger business than itx27s ever been Itx27s not always your fault Our modern economy is built on rotten ideas like labor  commodity If we want to do something about inequality itx27s time that we subject fundamentally unjust ideas like these to a serious critiqueip1 Thank you maceo a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fnewsycombinatorcomx2Fitemid9502757 relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fnewsycombinatorcomx2Fitemid9502757a,hackuser,2015-09-02 00:12:29+00:00,0,2248

I must say despite the gloomy outlook isnt the fact that most of the market is running on old machines not a bad onepWhy do you buy a new pc Why of course to do something your old one couldnt Now you have six year old consoles so your standard port wont be incredibly pretty or taxingpGive it a months after the launch of the nextgen consoles and PC sales should see an uptake as people start buying the awesome looking ports that are being crapped out in the dozens by the big AAA devshopspWhile it wont fix the market it should have a serious effect upon the profitability of a pc business Combined with the fact that your tablet which was nearing the current console power is now looking pretty bad that is even more reason for the market to keep on chugging with consumers realizing their all in one isnt the beauty they thought it waspYou guys say you havent upgraded in years because you can run the new games on a very decent level Just you wait,Everlag,2013-04-12 02:57:14+00:00,0,984

I think your approach to this situation is fine  There are poor ways to handle it thoughpA recent example  The developer maintains a tool that communicates with another internal system maintained by another group  That system is being migrated from a suite of applications running on internal blades to something that runs on kubernetes  The migration affects how processes are accessed IP addresses and ports and changes are required on our endpThis developer does not know anything about kubernetes and does not know anything about the changes in the other system  He does not understand why any access methods may have changed and he is irritated that an external system is pushing a new requirement onto his task list when it worked perfectly fine before  To be fair he does not ineedi to know anything about kubernetes to make this change but his resistance to the modification almost demanded an explanation of why it is necessary and then it devolved into the situation I just described,LordGrey,2022-07-28 12:17:55+00:00,0,1019

I agree with you that there isnx27t any legal discourse on implications Itx27s immaterial in these protests as it is a manifestation of despair due to economic reality and worsening living conditions without a hope of revivalp1 Extradition treaty require local competent court to make a decision whether to extradite or not But For majority of protestors it is immaterial because the perception is that Hong Kong do not have a decent judiciary or legal system it works at the whims of China again a perception created by few So the actual discussion no one wants to discuss or hearp2 YouTube Facebook and Twitter does not like privacy Because their basic business is to trade personal information and time for free service So try using any of them through TOR or VPN they will block you or make it very difficult independent from which country you belong In this aspect so far only EU is trying to preserve some privacy but still not enough with many loopholesp3 Again as I mentioned in no 1 here majority of the protestors do not even understand how extradition works So this discussion is secondary the primary reason the protests are taking place is due to bleak future outlook and harsh economic reality and living conditions as I mentioned in my previous comments living in a car parking size apartment space,dragonsh,2019-08-23 08:08:48+00:00,0,1347

Itx27s a good set of suggestions but it doesnx27t touch on the key problem with quotmobilequot interfaces  inotificationsi  The core evil dark design of most mobile interfaces to various networks social or not is that they can use notifications to get the user into their app  While therex27s some ability to restrict notifications therex27s still not huge support at least that I know of maybe it exists and Ix27ve missed it for levels of notification by default  You can go and turn some options off in an app if it supports it but in general there are tiers of notificationspHigh priority is quotThe world is on firequot  Be it your pager for work or more often in my case quotThe hill I live on is on fire iagainiquot these are the things a mobile device is useful for  Ix27d argue that phone calls serve this purpose currently because the cell network has made calls suck for everything else with latencypMost of the person to person communications outside group chats tends to fall into the quotImportant but not immediatequot category  This is what I tend to use my phone for so my notifications are around thispThen therex27s the clutter of other notifications ranging from quotOh hey you got more spam emailquot to quotPlease come check into our app again we miss your eyeballs on our adsquot  These are fairly unimportant and probably shouldnx27t exist in most cases  But most of them are low prioritypIx27d like to be able to set things up so that notifications are batched over some period of time instead of being immediate unless itx27s high priority  if my wife is sending me a picture of A or B at the store I need to respond to that quickly enough  But for other stuff Ix27d love to see batched notifications on an hourly or perhaps even daily basispI simulate this on my devices by largely running quotpullquot instead of quotpushquot for almost everything  outside direction communication from people which is what I use my phone for I have notifications turned off  I check my email often enough mostly that I donx27t need notifications for my primary account itx27s not for anything time sensitive so if I check once or twice a day this is fine though it does lead to some priority inversions in that infrequently used accounts actually do send prompt notifications  I donx27t have a way to queue these for once a day or something and still get notifications and I tend to fail to check them otherwisepIf you allow your devices to go back to quotpull modequot instead of quotpush modequot you remove a lot of the evils of most of the applications in terms of attention vampire effectspBut a more flexible notification system would be really really useful,Syonyk,2021-07-04 19:10:05+00:00,0,2853

Best partpgtWhile waiting for the May 1 reset might look tempting to launch directly into the 962 rate I still strongly recommend buying I Bonds before April 30 which will lock in a 712 rate for a full six months followed by 962 for six months Thats an annual rate of about 84 and there is no other very safe investment that can match that returnpgtI Bonds must be held for 12 months before you can redeem them If you redeem them before five years you will forfeit the last three months of interest But if you buy near the end of April 2022 you will get full credit for April and can redeem 14 months and a few days later avoiding taking the interest penalty on the 962 ratepgtHowever I always recommend buying I Bonds every year up to the purchase cap of 10000 per person per year and holding them until you actually need the money People who have been buying I Bonds for years  like many of my readers  are very happy right now collecting an annual rate of 84 plus any fixed rate attached to the original purchase,hnburnsy,2022-04-12 18:25:31+00:00,0,1064

iSo the bit shift question that come up down one branch of a system design question that we used for a while wex27ve since moved to a more targeted version that is more repeatable The subissue involved adding a binary flag to a large data blob this came up as part of a solution to a realworld caching problem Adding a single bit flag to the front of a 1GB blob has a problem To really add just one bit youx27d have to bitshift the entire 1GB This is clearly not worth it to save 7 bits of storage ignoring that that would not be saved in any case You can just use a byte or word or add the flag at the end When candidates suggested adding a bit flag at the front we would follow up asking them how theyx27d do it to unearth if they were using x27bitx27 as a shorthand for a reasonable solution or if they really are a little weak in binary data manipulation This was one small part of our interview By itself it in no way determined the outcome of the interview or even of the lowlevel systems section Plenty of great engineers might get it wrong But I donx27t think it was unfairipOf course itx27s unfair The candidate isnx27t actually programming a solution when theyx27re talking to you Theyx27re on a tight time crunch under a microscope in front of an interviewer The answers to your questions will literally make or break their future with you Did you specify to them in your original question that the entries in the cache are 1GB large If you assigned them the task of implementing a solution to your caching question they would immediately notice using a 1bit flag is a poor design decisionpThe point ispiPlenty of great engineers might get it wrongipThat says quite a lot more about Triplebytex27s question than the engineers A wrong answer doesnx27t mean theyx27re weak in bit manipulation or that they decide to implement poor solutions It says theyx27re suffering from interview jitters Theyx27re weak in the artificial environment youx27ve constructed for the purposes of the interview which may or may not correlate with their actual abilitypThis may sound like useless theorizing but unfortunately a massive number of excellent engineers are iawfuli in an interview setting But if you give them a problem to actually solve they pass with flying colorspTriplebyte does give problems to candidates to solve but it sounds like you also care about whether they can pass your interview by demonstrating sufficient max skill when prompted instead of whether they can implement solutions to the problems you assign to them This rules out candidates who would otherwise do very well which is the type of candidate youx27re trying to findpI know that youx27re saying the verbal section of the interview isnx27t the whole process but are you sure itx27s an effective onepIt might be positively misleading A candidate who is very strong in the area youx27re looking for is also likely to be someone who will get your questions completely wrong because theyx27re not programming Theyx27re talking So it sounds like youx27re selecting for people who can talk well those who can show strength during your interview when prompted verbally Is that the right metric to find talented candidatespIf you were to put together a pipeline where eg you give candidates an XCode codebase and say quotThere are bugs in this codebase and ltspecific missing featuresgt Implement as many fixes or improvements as you wish or have time for then send us the codequot you would have a mechanism which selects for candidates who are 100 competent since thatx27s exactly the type of work theyx27ll be doing on a daytoday basispSome candidates wouldnx27t want to do that so perhaps there should be an alternative for them But itx27d be vastly more effective than quizstyle questions during a timeboxed interviewpItx27s possible to come up with endless reasons why it might be a bad idea to set up a pipeline like that But all the companies that have set it up have been shocked how well it works when they rely isolelyi on that test Instead of an opportunity to show strength during an interview the candidate is able to directly answer the question quotCan they do the workquotpEDIT From one of the other comments a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fnewsycombinatorcomx2Fitemid13834231 relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fnewsycombinatorcomx2Fitemid13834231apgt I applied through their project track It was described as a lowpressure way to write your code ahead of time and talk about it in the interview The interview was instead about making changes to my project while Ammon watched Also there was a request to derive a formal proof while Ammon watched I didnx27t get it After which I got a rejection saying that my project was great but my interview performance was so poor that they wouldnx27t move forwardpIt sounds like Triplebyte almost has the pipeline described above but it wonx27t work if you watch the candidate or ask them to do more work The project alone has to be set up to be a sufficient demonstration of skill,sillysaurus3,2017-03-09 23:33:08+00:00,0,5284

I wasnx27t really sure why SpaceX decided to launch when they knew that recovering the first stage would be almost impossible when the waves in the Atlantic were 20x27 high  I guess recovery of the stage was the tertiary reason for the launch after the payload for the ISS and for the cubesats however was it critical to launch at that point or could they have waited a few more days for the weather to improvepOne thought which had occurred to me was maybe they needed to get people working on the upcoming Orbcomm OG2 launch which is currently scheduled for May  When you think about all the time and energy which goes into fabricating the rocket along with all nine Merlin engines it really hits home how significant of an achievement making reusable rockets will be when SpaceX pulls it off  You have to think that at some point in the nottoodistant future it would be absolutely crazy to launch a rocket where you knew you were going to lose the first stage,Patrick_Devine,2014-04-21 00:22:22+00:00,0,981

A few things that I notice in the area where Ix27m somewhat active as an OSM contributorp You probably shouldnx27t render guideposts or route markers on the map or at least not with generic quotinfoquot iconp Things with accessprivate are likely not terribly relevant to people looking at the map This will include things like parking spots or gardensp Lots of shots and amenities have icons but doctors donx27t Neither do fire stationsp Sports pitches are shown as nodes but may be better shown as areas since they often cover quite extensive swaths of ground thatx27s otherwise empty with just an icon in the middle Same with playgrounds schools and kindergartens gardens and parksp For buildings and building parts if you donx27t make use of the parts in any way such as showing roofs height etc perhaps just disregard the parts and only render the building outlines This combined with the fact that geometries seem to be simplified even at the highest zoom levels results in a bit of a mess of lines at times where some outlines are simplified differently from others that ishouldi actually share parts of the same edges and thus overlap perfectly eg a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Avenue3Away2F111206435 relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Avenue3Away2F11120a or a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Avenue3Away2F111206435 relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Avenue3Away2F11120a Same thing with the geometry simplification also happens with adjacent geometry that should actually not have gaps eg semidetached houses or garages next to houses Lots of buildings that are actually rectangular also get quite weird anglesp Tunnels are quite subtle And while at least roads in tunnels donx27t overlap buildings that are actually above them like with Carto itx27s still hard to make out whatx27s above and whatx27s below in such cases eg a hrefhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Astreet3Apolyline3A30081121 relnofollowhttpsx2Fx2Fmapsearthx2Fplacex2Fopenstreetmap3Astreet3Apolyline3a Culverts for waterways are handled better than roads in tunnels in this casepOverall though this seems like a quite nice map style Closer to Google Maps in that it emphasizes roads but some people like the less detailed look and it works better with vector maps I guess to have fewer polygons to render,ygra,2022-08-23 12:43:25+00:00,0,2625

It is indeed amazing but the answer can be simpler Without pain there is no such thing as not pain You need to feel what pain is so that you know what it feels like to not have painpIf we all were in some sort of utopia or heaven we would be dead bored Life is good because we keep learning and in pain there is much learning which is different from the learning one acquires when not in pain If there was only one state of being there would not be many opportunities for growth In life however there are many states of being between absolute pain and absolute not pain which gives one so much room for growth and learning and also variety for everyone to be unique in their own waypOnce one stops learning however everything is familiar and eventually boring Which is why the concept of heaven or hell is attractive at first but only because we are not in heaven or hell It is like buying those gorgeous trousers you wanted or car which eventually becomes just a pair of trousers or just a car So too with heaven if it existed it would be great in the first days or week or month but in a year you would get dead bored of it and want to move to America again P,Ardit20,2010-08-23 13:11:55+00:00,0,1191

"62 iI dont understand where the fixation for multiple founders stems fromipBasically the YC model stems from PG recreating his experience with ViaWeb  He started a company with his
best friend and another expert programmer so thats the model that seems like the right model to thempOthers have very different experiences working with other people eg the muchmaligned igroup projectsi in
college so they have a different mental model of what works and what doesnt at least for themselvespThere are extremely valid arguments both ways which largely boil down to individual variation but heres a
key point that gets overlooked  Perhaps if you havent done it as a single founder you dont know what it
takes and so you dont know what to look forpHe ihasi done it in a group  So if youre good at picking twos and threes or feel you are you can fill up
your whole complement with thosepAnd then it becomes selfreinforcing  You get more and more confident with the one than the other which is
avoided  Some pitchers rely on their fastball and dont develop their sliderpSo eventually youre looking at lets say for sake of illustration 90 confidence in picking groups but
hardly any confidence still in picking solo founderspSo when youre looking at the last slot do you want to add another group you are 90 sure of or say no to
someone you are excited about and go with some solo founder you are dubious about  And what about the
secondtolast slot  And all the way back  Surely your FIRST choice isnt going to be a solo founderpEven though YC claims not to have a fixed limit obviously there is a practical limit  And when they say
they fund everyone they find promising you have to take it with a grain of salt because in their model
being a single founder already isnt promising",seven_stones,2011-10-19 08:47:56+00:00,0,1866
