In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill.

You don't have a right to lay one finger on a police officer (or to dump buckets of water on an officer, etc. as we've seen recently) because that is ASSAULT and stealing a weapon is THEFT and ASSAULT and therefore, police are fully justified and authorized to respond with the use of deadly force if necessary.",3 years ago,1

They asked if he had any weapons and he got a quick pat, they never got a chance to do a search incident to arrest because you don't do that until a suspect is in cuffs. What they and everyone knows is he was compliant and officers respectful until he initiated non-compliance and resisted arrest fir a violation, he then assaulted 2 officers, he then took a taser which became a weapon of opportunity fled and used it shooting at police as he fled. So a violent aggressor, who just assalted police with a weapon of opportunity and no problem using it against police gets shot? That is what is happens when you make decisions like this. Had he ran, no weapon and the shot him i would be grilling the police. Had the police acted in any way other than a professional manner or treated him with less respect due any person of any race, i would be again grilling their asses. What i am not going to do is give Mr. Brooks a pass on decisions he made leading up to his arrest, you do something, even something stupid, own that shit like a man.

He served only months of a 5 year sentence. The man got a second chance. What did he do? He passed out drunk in his car in a drive thru. He knew if he was arrested that this would be a parole violation and he would go back to prison. He made his choice to drink and drive, which could‚Äôve killed innocent people itself.

I understood it when it started and felt for black America but i lost complete respect for it when i saw how the left act and how they conduct themselves and the supports behind it and their background and what they are actually during yet supposedly fighting for.  Especially dislike how they  want to not admit all lives matter and you must not say or think it but must say Black lives matter? Its no longer a movement its now a threat and an agenda. Sorry truth hurts and they are losing their voice especially how all the antifa and hooligans are running around the street and rioting an looting. Now look at Wendy's state. What did God damn Wendys have to do with what happened? That's why I cant preach BLM. I just see it as a democratic supporter, Money laundering, antifa backing hate message that actually causes division more than the people say the president has done. This black cop on here had perfect sense and it just goes to show he does not see color but logic. Ray was a very nice guy and I would have acted differently if I were the cop and not run after him if he has my taser but they are trained to shoot if they are threatened and attacked and if they feel they can be subdued or killed. Now put yourself in Rays shoes. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THE TASER IN THE FIRST PLACE? That would be the last thing running in my mind If i were desperate to go home and wanted to run away. And THAT'S the difference. Some people dont think and make it worse for themselves and you are taught/learned this since a kid when interacting with police. I know very well what I should NEVER do. And that's placing my hands on the police let alone his belt unless I wanted a worse charge or be shot. No matter how desperate or mad or if the cops were asshoels and had no right. They will only get backup and they will find you and you'll be in a worse rut for attacking and resisting etc. Folks you need to accept responsibility and be held accountable for your actions. These cops were more than nice and professional and they prolonged and beared the interaction with Ray more than I would have.  To make it worse now they want to seek the death penalty for the officer? Ridiculous. If the officers were picking on Ray and being racist and bullying him and shot and killed Ray planting the weapon in his hand to make it look like a struggle (like some cops have done actually) then I will agree the cop is corrupt and his death penalty is justified. THIS is CLEARLY not the case. People need to understand or cant comprehend the police training and what you learned and bring to your interactions and being on edge all the time with each stop and the heat of the moment when Ray fought and your on adrenaline and they shot you with a taser, your instincts and your adrenaline filled quick judgements can be impaired or misconstrued or training kicks in.",3 years ago,0

First the guy was given TWO OPPORTUNITIES  to park and sleep it off.    First time the guy passed out AGAIN.   The first time the officer had to beat on the window, open the door ....kept trying to get him to wake up.  Had to actually poke him to wake him up.  .........tells the guy to park and sleep it off.   officer is walking back to his car turns around to watch.  car ahead of the guy that was passed out moves up, guy doesn't move the car.   OFFICE GOES BACK .......dudes passed out AGAIN.... THEN AGAIN the officer says just pull over there and sleep it off.   So this time the guy actually does drive the car over to park it.  As the police officer is going back to his car the driver of the white care goes over the curb.  You can hear the office giggling when this happens.      i stand corrected, the video is 43 minutes long which includes the shooting..... dash cam.... you can here what's atleast a second tazer shot going off plus the 3 gun shots.   but we saw what happened with the wendy's cam.
