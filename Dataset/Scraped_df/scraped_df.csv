@SIl_Ae,"I always ask myself the same question when it comes to police shootings. ""Don't they train to know where to aim?""

There's a massive difference in aiming at someone with a deadly weapon assaulting you and chasing someone.

@Darell2710,"Yes he made a mistake, but there was no reason for the police to shoot him. You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest. In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill.

@FPVREVIEWS,"Not up to me to determine, but if he takes the cop's taser, and tries shooting them with it, the cops are in danger of being incapacitated (what the taser is for) and then their deadly weapons could be taken, so from the cop's point of view, it's the same as if he took their gun.  (and for all practical purposes its the same, because after he successfully tases a cop, NOTHING stops him from taking their firearms.  And since he has already shown intent to use force against them, it's reasonable to assume he would continue to do so if given the chance.   It still sucks that they chose to shoot him, and could not deal with it in another way that did not result in his death, but this will be hard to prove that it was not justified, because it's relatively easy to prove that it was.   Sad all around, and condolences to the family. There has to be a better way.  how about throwing him the cuffs and asking him to put them on?   not sure, but somebody figure something out, so this does not keep happening.",3 years ago,0

@Sturmavk,A MAN that's drunk driving gets questioned for 45 minutes by two very respectful officers. The man fails a field sobriety test. The man then resists arrest and commits 5 to 10 different felony assaults on officers. It's abundantly clear to all that have watched the full video that the man is clearly winning the brawl versus the two officers. The man then wrestles a weapon away from one of the officers.

@DerangedLeftWingers,"Rayshard Brooks had been serving a sentence for beating his own kids. He was released early on parole due to the mayor‚Äôs COVID-19 response. He served only months of a 5 year sentence. The man got a second chance. What did he do? He passed out drunk in his car in a drive thru. He knew if he was arrested that this would be a parole violation and he would go back to prison. He made his choice to drink and drive, which could‚Äôve killed innocent people itself. He chose to resist arrest. He chose to attack the officers. He chose to run from the scene. He chose to use a weapon against the arresting officers. Seems to me that this man made a lot of choices that resulted in this outcome. You can thank the mayor of Atlanta for allowing this man back in to society. It‚Äôs also ironic to hear the Fulton County DA refer to the police using tasers against ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù a couple of weeks ago as deadly force. But when a policeman is attacked with a taser, all of a sudden deadly force against a taser is unjustified. The democrats own the education system, the media, Hollywood, Big Tech and administrative government. If there is systematic racism or oppression, it‚Äôs at the feet of democrats. Lifelong democrat politicians who never did anything to improve the lives of their constituents, only to pander with the race card every time election season rolls around should be a wake up call for all to see the true hypocrisy that exists within the democrat party.

I understood it when it started and felt for black America but i lost complete respect for it when i saw how the left act and how they conduct themselves and the supports behind it and their background and what they are actually during yet supposedly fighting for.  Especially dislike how they  want to not admit all lives matter and you must not say or think it but must say Black lives matter? Its no longer a movement its now a threat and an agenda. Sorry truth hurts and they are losing their voice especially how all the antifa and hooligans are running around the street and rioting an looting. Now look at Wendy's state. What did God damn Wendys have to do with what happened? That's why I cant preach BLM. I just see it as a democratic supporter, Money laundering, antifa backing hate message that actually causes division more than the people say the president has done. This black cop on here had perfect sense and it just goes to show he does not see color but logic. Ray was a very nice guy and I would have acted differently if I were the cop and not run after him if he has my taser but they are trained to shoot if they are threatened and attacked and if they feel they can be subdued or killed. Now put yourself in Rays shoes. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THE TASER IN THE FIRST PLACE? That would be the last thing running in my mind If i were desperate to go home and wanted to run away. And THAT'S the difference. Some people dont think and make it worse for themselves and you are taught/learned this since a kid when interacting with police. I know very well what I should NEVER do. And that's placing my hands on the police let alone his belt unless I wanted a worse charge or be shot. No matter how desperate or mad or if the cops were asshoels and had no right. They will only get backup and they will find you and you'll be in a worse rut for attacking and resisting etc. Folks you need to accept responsibility and be held accountable for your actions. These cops were more than nice and professional and they prolonged and beared the interaction with Ray more than I would have.  To make it worse now they want to seek the death penalty for the officer? Ridiculous. If the officers were picking on Ray and being racist and bullying him and shot and killed Ray planting the weapon in his hand to make it look like a struggle (like some cops have done actually) then I will agree the cop is corrupt and his death penalty is justified. THIS is CLEARLY not the case. People need to understand or cant comprehend the police training and what you learned and bring to your interactions and being on edge all the time with each stop and the heat of the moment when Ray fought and your on adrenaline and they shot you with a taser, your instincts and your adrenaline filled quick judgements can be impaired or misconstrued or training kicks in.",3 years ago,0

After he move his car, he kept lying that his girl friend dropped him off at Wendy's drive through line and went back to hotel. lol.. Then he resisted officer took his taser gun and ran. Then he turned around and fired that taser gun. I don't know why that official was fired. He was doing his job and the guy was NOT unarmed when he was shot. He was firing ****ing taser gun he stole from officer at him. This was fully justified act. Stop trying to cover up the truth. It is different from George Floyd case.

The guy here made THREE, not one, but THREE horrible mistakes: 1) He got drunk, that's why he passed out in the middle of parking lot; 2) He resisted arrest and grabbed their taser, I mean, are you  stupid? Whether you are right or wrong, do not resist an arrest, the one that WILL get killed is you, not the police offers; 3) The guy ran away... making him look suspicious, what did the officers do? What any other person would've done, try to stop him... they shot him.",3 years ago,0
@Edward1312,"They didn't need to kill him just because he was drunk and intoxicated. He was shot dead because he was drunk and disorderly. They should have let him run, he wasn't a threat to anyone he wasn't armed and was running away. He would have been picked up the next day because it wouldn't have been difficult to identify him. Hell, when he was sober he would have probably handed himself. Just because he was intoxicated and resisted arrest it didn't give the police free licence to effectively execute him on the spot for what is a traffic violation effecting no one else. The Police should not have the right to execute someone for that.",3 years ago,0

The first time the officer had to beat on the window, open the door ....kept trying to get him to wake up.  Had to actually poke him to wake him up.  .........tells the guy to park and sleep it off.   officer is walking back to his car turns around to watch.  car ahead of the guy that was passed out moves up, guy doesn't move the car.   OFFICE GOES BACK .......dudes passed out AGAIN.... THEN AGAIN the officer says just pull over there and sleep it off.   So this time the guy actually does drive the car over to park it.  As the police officer is going back to his car the driver of the white care goes over the curb.  You can hear the office giggling when this happens.      i stand corrected, the video is 43 minutes long which includes the shooting..... dash cam.... you can here what's atleast a second tazer shot going off plus the 3 gun shots.   but we saw what happened with the wendy's cam.
