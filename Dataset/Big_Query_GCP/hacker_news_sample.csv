"&gt; That isn&#x27;t really the point. The point is that the US armed forces already use space for military purposes so extensively that they even have a whole branch dedicated to space militarization.<p>Military use of space != &quot;militarization [of space].&quot;  My understanding is that the US Space Force pretty much just controls space assets <i>used</i> by the military that are comparable to civilian ones (i.e. sensor, communication, and navigation satellites).

"One of the primary traits of a good developer is a strong desire for excellence. If a developer is willing to settle for a mediocre and boring design, then that is some (perhaps small) evidence that the book may contain mediocre and boring content.<p>Anecdotally: At the TechWeek Chicago job fair, there was a very high correlation between booths with good logos and graphic design and interesting people behind the booth. All of my good conversations were with people at the well designed booths.<p>EDIT: This is especially true since we are expected to pay for the book before we get access to it. This means that we cannot judge its quality in any holistic way, but must do our best to pre-judge its quality through various social signals.",semiel,2013-07-16 21:07:12+00:00,comment
"After feeling very down, so much that I didn&#x27;t felt like myself, I started to experiment with herbal supplements. Valerian to sleep, but my problem wasn&#x27;t lack of sleep. St John&#x27;s Wort for mood, but I didn&#x27;t feel moody.<p>I tried 5-htp, which from my understanding is a precursor to the biosynthesis of Serotonin. The effect was immediate. I felt light headed, buzzed even. I felt as if I had suddenly woken up in a bright new world. I went groceries shopping could barely keep myself from gaping at all the colours, products and people. The next day, those effects were gone but I felt fine. Simply fine. I tried to take more 5-htp, but those strong effects are gone. I am no brain scientist, but to me this is anecdotal evidence that I was very much lacking in Serotonin and that this herbal supplement boosted me right back up.<p>It&#x27;s not magical, I still feel anxious about deadlines and stressed about hard to deal with clients. However, some kind of dark blurry veil has been lifted from my perception of life.<p>Edit: Since then, I increased my weekly physical activities and improved my overall eating habits. I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s directly linked with my increase (or rather closer to normal) Serotonin but my instinct says yes.",Raphmedia,2016-01-26 15:03:03+00:00,comment
"First, you asserted that it was wrong for Party B (your wife) to suffer because Party A (a thief) took her laptop. It was unclear whether you were only trying to point out that opportunism isn't always moral, or if you were also making the allegation that what the OP had initially done in this case was immoral. (which it is now clear you were not) I was simply comparing the morality of Twitter in this case to the morality of the OP.<p>Second, the position I attributed to you was a natural extension of your argument, if you don't qualify such a statement as part of a discussion I'm going to assume you are applying your suggestion to the discussion as a whole.

"The nice thing about Torque and an OBD-II dongle is the fact that it can help you diagnose those &quot;random&quot; issues that only happen occasionally.<p>You set up Torque into logging mode, clear your codes, turn on the GPS and mapping, and drive away. When your car does &quot;that thing&quot; take a note of the time, then when you get home, go back thru the logs around that time mark, and take a look at all the sensor data, plus any thrown codes. If you know your car, and understand what is going on, it can help you to narrow down the diagnosis.<p>While a regular code reader (or getting the codes read) will help you by giving you the codes, being able to get the codes, timestamped in a log along with sensor data can go much farther in telling you where a particular problem lies.<p>While there are other code readers out there that will do this logging and tracking too, they typically cost hundreds or thousands of dollars - well out of the price range of most home mechanics.<p>There are many other things that Torque can do or be used for (for instance, virtual gauges are a nice feature - you can set up an Android tablet with a cluster of them giving you much more feedback than you can get from your regular dash instrument cluster, and it&#x27;s cheaper and easier than setting up a bunch of physical gauges on a stock vehicle).",cr0sh,2017-07-07 16:34:00+00:00,comment

"I’ve have a decade of PHP development under my belt and have been reflecting on why PHP, despite recent improvements to language, is still problematic. One side of me says that the community should just let PHP be “PHP”; if a Typescript for PHP were made, would the community embrace it or lament it? The other side of me says that it’s not PHP, the language, that is problematic, it’s simply _how_ it is used; for example, PHP frameworks—although useful and serve a purpose—don’t really result in less debugging time nor do they make code more literate or smaller in scope.<p>So the question I pose is: A. Should PHP as a language be augmented, like TS does for JS, or B. Should the community focus on the methodology of PHP to make development simpler? What are some concrete propositions you can imagine that argue for either case?<p>I think any PHP developer can propose more than one new feature they would like to see. As for A, I personally would like to see an actual native module system. As for B, I would like to see less MVC frameworks and more macro systems within the ecosystem.",poletopole,2020-09-09 04:32:55+00:00,story

"I spent some more time thinking about this and wrote the following.<p>Modern scientists move small amounts of biological materials using a tool called the pipette.  Pipettes can work with very small amounts of liquid- down the microliter.  When you&#x27;re running a delicate experiment being able to deliver the precise amount of liquid is critical.<p>Pipettes need to be calibrated.  How do you calibrate a device that works with volumes of liquid?  Volumes of liquid are hard to measure.  Fortunately, water at STP (standard temp and pressure) has a known mass, so you attempt to draw 1 mL, and weigh it.  1 mL of water weighs 1 gram at STP (this is not a coincidence- it&#x27;s by definition).<p>OK so you&#x27;re weighing 1 gram of water and adjusting the pipette&#x27;s calibrator knob so that 1mL on the pipette weighs 1 gram.<p>I guess that means your weighing scale needs to be calibrated, too.  Huh.  These sorts of scales aren&#x27;t just &quot;weigh some flour for baking&quot;, either.  They have to be accurate to the hundredth of a gram, and have walls to avoid fluctuations due to air currents(!!!!) and minor temp changes.  The scales are calibrated using calibrated test weights.<p>Oh dear.  Calibrated test weights?  If you follow the turtles <i>all</i> the way down, you find that there is actually a tracebility chain from your calibrated scale back to one of the defined weights held by NIST, the NIST equivalents in France and Japan (they all share their weights).  So you can actually calculate- using those weird rules of error propagation you forget in high school- the error of your scale as a product of the errors in that chain (often, knowing your error bars is more important than knowing the accurate answer).<p>But that&#x27;s not all.  Those defined weights?  They&#x27;re obsolete.  Le Grand K (the origin of the kilogram, still kept under lock and key) changed weight over time due to subtle metallurigcal details.<p>The new definition of the standard is created by an obscure machine at NIST, just like the time standards.  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kibble_balance"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kibble_balance</a> is the tool used to do it, and it depends on the NIST time reference.<p>So, turtles all the way down until you get the rubidium fountain.",dekhn,2021-02-04 18:40:05+00:00,comment

"The two biggest competitors to Byte Buddy today are javassist and cglib. Both of them work quite differently:<p>javassist takes strings containing Java code and compiles these strings at runtime. This makes it simple to use as every Java developer knows Java. Unfortunately, the javassist compiler lags a lot behind the actual javac compiler. For example, it does not support generics or even auto-boxing, not to speak of lambda expressions. Also, Strings are not type-safe what makes javassist code quite error prone. (It is the equivalent of concenating SQL strings together, with all the risks like foreign code injection.)<p>cglib allows you to register callbacks for an overridden class, similar to the JDK proxies. However, this requires that all class loaders know about cglib if they want to know these cglib-proxies as cglib-specific types are hard-coded into any generated class. Also, cglib only allows subclassing but not the rewrital of existing classes. Furthermore, the callbacks require any arguments to be boxed and registeres these boxed values into arrays. It turns out that cglib is not quite Just-In-Time-compiler friendly.<p>Byte Buddy works with annotations or its type-safe DSL and realizes its instrumentation mostly based on delegating to user code. This way, you can implement interceptors in any JVM language and you avoid dependencies on Byte Buddy within the generated classes (annotations are fortunately ignored by JVM class loaders if they cannot be resolved at load-time). This makes for example for better exception stack traces than when using &quot;string code&quot;. Also, Byte Buddy avoids boxing by creating smarter objects for the interceptors and only creates those interceptors that are requested by annotated arguments, using dependency injection.<p>ASM or BCEL are rather byte code parser than code generation libraries. You need to have a clear concept of how byte code works in order to use them. Also, those libraries allow you to create &quot;unverified code&quot;, i.e. you have to do a lot manually. Byte Buddy is itself built on top of ASM, you can even plug ASM code into Byte Buddy if you need to.",raphw,2015-03-04 14:29:52+00:00,comment

"Hello.<p>[LongSelfIntrospectionRantAlert]<p>I'm in my early 20s, out of college for 1 year now with a degree that decrees me as an engineer. Although I've pulled through the better part of my academics with decent grades, I've been fighting what seems to be a losing war with mediocrity. At this time, I'm facing a severe motivational crisis to do any fscking thing in life.<p>In no particular order, the below mentioned points describe my current state of mind and work:<p>a) I hold a long standing consulting career as a developer. I got sucked into this at some point during college. While the money is reasonable (for where I live), the work itself is normally pretty uninspiring.<p>b) I have a modest amount of contributions in f/oss-land. I wish to do more, but frequently turned off by how all the projects I'm related to work.<p>c) I fiddle with a couple of ideas -- mostly forks of f/oss projects. Juggling as many things as I am, and being a one man army, there's very little of achieving much. At this point, I've also given up on approaching b-people for funding or fellow geeks into collaborating. I'm also considering giving up altogether.<p>d) Outside the tech-zone, I ""partner"" a small travel-related startup. This was showing hope at one time, but now it's probably at the end of it's lease.<p>e) I'm also at a low as far as personal life goes.  The last breakup happened more than an year back now. I'll admit that I'm emotionally, sexually frustrated. Being compulsively prudish hasn't helped me find the short term solution either.<p>f)I also suffer from chronic wanderlust. This is one of the reasons I've been keen on being all by myself. I've come to understand that this is important for my sanity.<p>Currently, my life revolves around my folks, code, IRC, HN, reddit, coffee, lemon tea and travel. Being mostly shy and introverted, My behavior these days is quasi-sociophobic.<p>Back on the topic, I've tried to identify a few options for the way forward. Please feel free to suggest more:<p>a) Push for a post-grad in some US-varsity: Although I can bet on the GRE, I'm neither technically (albeit for some reasonable programming ability) strong nor inclined to academics anymore. Besides, exiling from my hometown doesn't sound like a great proposition.<p>b)Drown in the ocean: I've penetrated openings in big companies in campus selections at college. It won't be hard to be there again. I will probably have to bear some backtracking in terms of income.<p>c) Management: 
I was inspired by the amount of credence MBAs from good B-schools tended to get at various startup / entrepreneurship events I've been to. I'm also told that a tech background + MBA is a killer combo.<p>I've thought that this would be the best fix for making peace with the depression caused by mediocrity and under-achievement this far.<p>The catch 22 is that competition for B-school entrances here is rather high. Realistically (with my motivational issues as of now), I don't see myself making the cut. I wouldn't want to settle for yet another mediocre school.<p>d) Inertia:
Empty catch. Just hope I get lucky.<p>Any life-changing, inspiring advice from HN'ers would be appreciated. Please recount similar experiences if any.",lollerskates,2010-06-21 19:49:37+00:00,story

"I’d isolate literature from this though. Literature has always been a medium with a limited audience. In the past due to most people being illiterate compared to modern times where it isn’t accessible to many people due to literary complexity.<p>The last 100 or so years has been an anomaly in that for the first time in history we had a highly literate population that could read fiction. And for much of this era movies and TV were not as accessible to create or consume. But today it is both affordable to create, distribute, and consume fiction via the motion picture therefore making written fiction niche as the audience for it isn’t interested in the literary aspect of it so much as the story telling element. So as we’ve had cumulatively more content disseminated at at accelerating pace it has made most written fiction as obsolete as the parlor singer or traveling news reader. Implanting the stories would do to TV what TV has done popular books.<p>May be it time or effort, modern story dissemination technology allows people to consume more fiction per hour.

Many English dialects (the majority, given that it&#x27;s how America does it?) would say &quot;January twelveth, 2022&quot;, so 01-12-2022.<p>It&#x27;s not that the notation is spun around, some versions of English just pronounce the dates backwards! This is the exact opposite of the question asked about numbers, where English (usually, mostly) follows the &quot;logical&quot; order.<p>As language is subjective, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a right or wrong way to pronounce and order things. The West doesn&#x27;t use lakh and crore, but there&#x27;s no reason why the short scale is any better.

"We had to redo an inhouse Electron app in WPF because we came to the point where we had to do some stuff within windows, e.g. printing or create a heavily customized MSI file. Both is possible with Electron but with the native Windows solution it&#x27;s easier to fine-tune behavior.<p>I think for UI and some web stuff Electron might really be superior. Especially if your team is already fluent with the web stack. But it has it&#x27;s limits and if you reach them or have very specific requirements you might be better of with WPF or UWP apps and the initially higher effort of developing in C#&#x2F;XAML might pay off.<p>Saying this I believe the existence of Electron is a great possibility for UI devs.",v0lta,2017-01-15 15:48:22+00:00,comment
"&gt;I still don&#x27;t understand how they&#x27;re ready to blame China so viciously for something that they tell us is just a flu and not even worth using face coverings or risking taking a vaccine. Not to mention magic cures like HCQ. All these efforts were just to deflect from the last government&#x27;s failure to contain the virus. And they&#x27;re not even internally consistent with each other. &quot;The virus is not dangerous, the left is just hyping and faking it. But the not-dangerous virus is completely China and Fauci&#x27;s dangerous fault and they must be raked over the coals for it so Trump doesn&#x27;t have to take any responsibility&quot;.<p>This is more a collective inconsistency than an individual inconsistency. But yes these issues when layered with politics tend to just use whichever spaghetto sticks to the wall.<p>&gt;Regardless of where the virus came from, it&#x27;ll keep happening like it did in history when there no labs, either naturally, a lab escape or a bio weapon. The right way is to be prepared for it, and take collective action to stop global pandemics.<p>I still think it&#x27;s important to find out where it came from. If leaked from a lab, what was done wrong that can be avoided in the future? If it really did happen out in the wild, how can monitoring be improved? The Trump administration was wholly ineffective at stopping it, but it&#x27;s not like decisive action in the US would have stopped it from spreading elsewhere. Bolsonaro would still be president of Brazil. There is utility in getting as close to what really happened as possible and trying to mitigate it.<p>Maybe virologists working directly with pathogens should have to wear masks out in public all the time.<p>&gt;The right way is to be prepared for it, and take collective action to stop global pandemics.<p>I know this whole thing has changed me and I will be continuing to wear a mask in public well after the mask mandates have ended.

"I can&#x27;t speak for the spec authors, but IMHO, tags should be deprecated and eventually removed when they are deemed to be useless, especially when their functions and&#x2F;or semantics are covered by another tag, and <i>especially</i> when their use is harmful (or rather, more harmful than beneficial).<p>In my (very personal) opinion, an HTML tag or attribute, and more generally a feature of any design&#x2F;development framework, should be considered possibly harmful if it:<p>- presents possible security problems; for examples, consider some of the points listed here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html5sec.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html5sec.org&#x2F;</a><p>- promotes poor usability or accessibility; e.g. interactive tooltips with links or controls in them, for example, are quite difficult to make accessible, and I wouldn&#x27;t want an HTML &lt;tooltip&gt; tag without a lot of discussion about accessibility<p>- promotes anti-patterns; e.g., at this point I think &lt;marquee&gt;-style scrolling informational text is an anti-pattern in a web context, since it can the text much harder to read, especially on small screens<p>Of course, none of these concerns should lead to immediate removal of a thing as soon as they&#x27;re pointed out, but they should be discussed and considered. It&#x27;s a cost-benefit analysis: what does this feature actually buy us that isn&#x27;t easily achievable with other features, what problems is it causing and how severe are they, and are the benefits worth the problems?<p>As for &lt;menu&gt;, my guess, though I haven&#x27;t been able to find the actual discussion, is that it was removed because its semantics are somewhat in conflict with &lt;nav&gt;, and probably its most common use was custom context (aka &quot;right-click&quot;) menus, which bring a lot of accessibility problems with them. I don&#x27;t know that I agree with the decision to remove it altogether, since I think its use to semantically identify and group web application controls is very valuable and not covered by any other tags (though I&#x27;d love to be corrected), but I do think that context menus, which to me seems like the most common use for the &lt;menu&gt; tag, are a very problematic design element. Again, it&#x27;s a balance; is it worth the problems it causes? I guess the authors decided it wasn&#x27;t.<p>(Just to reiterate, I don&#x27;t know why &lt;menu&gt; was removed, I&#x27;m just guessing.

"&gt; you&#x27;re likely decreasing modularity by introducing interdependencies via the file system.<p>Unless dependencies are already there. Then needlessly separating them into containers just makes the system have a higher overhead and have a higher fragility.<p>Say should the monitoring software be in a different conainter? But it looks at logs, so now it needs to mount a shared folder or coordinate sending logs via sockets. Or maybe it is a helper process. Like an indexer.  Putting that in a  separate container with its isolated OS dependencies might not make sense.

"I know I shouldn't feed trolls but I also feel I should clarify some things.<p>I started developing software professionally about a quarter of a century ago, on Apple IIs using the built-in BASIC, 6502 machine language and assorted toolkits for graphics and animation. For a long time, I used Microsoft technologies, from Actor (a Smalltalk-like environment that ran on Windows) to Visual Basic, Visual C++ (mostly for WinCE) and assorted MS web technologies. I also did a lot of web stuff on Unix platforms at the same time. It was not until 2002 that I made my switch to Unixes complete. Unless you develop for Windows, it makes little to no sense to develop on Windows and, as far as you are comfortable with other platforms, it makes little to no sense to deploy to Windows. It's expensive, not particularly predictable and the hood comes soldered. Not a good thing on a server.<p>In fact, I like to develop on a platform as close as possible to the deployment platform.

"1) If you use Mission Control, there's a linen background hidden behind the desktop. If you open the Notification Center, there's a linen background hidden behind the desktop. But if you change desktop spaces, there's only black - where's the linen (i.e. what happened to that permament physical textured backdrop Apple apparently decided was the bedrock of the UI?)<p>2) Not to mention that gross effect when you change desktop spaces, and the whole desktop slides over - including the menu bar (that apparently static, foundational part of the UI) - to be replace by a new menu bar! The dock doesn't change, so why does the menu bar?<p>3) And of course that other gross effect when you click full screen on an app (that little full-screen button nestled oddly in the top right corner of the window chrome above all the other little static buttons) - and the whole thing morphs and bulges and slides into a new space. Yeesh.<p>4) And yeah, Launchpad. So now apps are scattered between the dock, the application folder, and the Launchpad. Great.<p>5) Also, the Finder seems to get worse with every generation.<p>Really though, it's the sum of all the parts that offends me. When I see people with their sleek Macbook Airs on their laps, then I look at their screens, and I see stacks and stacks of scattered windows of all shapes and sizing clustered over the desktop, and everywhere, fiddly little tiny click targets (in the menu bar, in the windows themselves, in the window chrome - don't get me started on those ghastly mini traffic light buttons for mini windows...) And they're moving their fingers around in that little touchpad controlling that little mouse pointer on the screen, tapping on the little targets or slowly dragging things around...<p>All of this stuff was fine when computers were big slow things that sat on desks, running a handful of low-res apps at a time, driven by a mouse and keyboard. Back then, it wasn't possible to implement the fast, fluid, colourful graphical design and interface features of Metro. Windows had to be static heavy things that you carefully dragged around, resizing individual edges one mouse drag at a time. Nothing had any momentum, the whole window stack just sort of sat there like a pile of lead sheets. But now that computers are in our laps, or in our hands, and our computer use is spread between multiple device, and more often than not the average person is using a touchpad or a touchscreen to browse the internet (which has expanded into something so huge it no longer makes any sense to bottle it up in a single browser window) - and especially now that touchscreens are about to become ubiquitous on every single laptop sold in the world - the old static clunky WIMP model needs to be shuffled off to the side in place of something that makes more sense.<p>I will note that Mountain Lion isn't qualitatively worse for this new stage of computing than, say, Windows 7. But I have no respect for the small attempts to modernise the OS with ported iOS features. It's putting lipstick on a pig (admittedly a pig that was very good and useful for a long time and still has a lot of value in many different contexts.)

The number of grants made by OSF over the years must be in the hundreds of thousands. It&#x27;s ridiculous to claim that Soros is personally involved in financing Islamism. (As a Finnish taxpayer, I probably have as much involvement in indirectly supporting some Islamist group -- there must be a botched aid project where Finnish money ended up in the hands of Somalian militants, for example.

"Do you like actively trading?<p>If you do, chances are you lose money. 85% of active individual investors lose money, for an aggregate loss of around $1trn per year.<p>Several major causes of this are outside the control of investors:<p>1. Wall Street has a large informational edge.<p>2. Wrongdoing towards individual investors goes unpunished by the government and regulators, with a revolving door between these two and Wall Street.<p>3. Short-term frictional costs eat into a short-term trading style.<p>4. Brokerages now have a business model of selling customer trades to financial institutions. This is rife with conflicts of interest and abuse, with limited transparency.<p>5. Brokerages are incentivized to push a bad trading style on their clients and do so, in order to maximize their own revenue.<p>Phoenix seeks to provide better financial outcomes for individuals actively trading markets, with no potential for trading losses for any participants, but a real chance for big gains.<p>We aim to reduce the $1trn loss of active individual investors by 98% (we plan to take the last 2% as our revenue), and to build a new community and product for them that has the core focus of improving investor outcomes. Every other individual investor brokerage product we’ve reviewed ultimately has the goal of exploiting them more, or in a new way. We’re taking a radically different approach.<p>How does this work?<p>Our core product doesn’t involve any interaction with real financial markets or institutions. Instead, we simply ingest market data into our app, and all customer trades are virtual based on these real prices. This means that investors trade in exactly the same way as they would in a real brokerage, just with simpler liquidity, algorithmic derivative pricing, and no real consequences if things go wrong (like margin calls, taxes on unrealized gains, or debt from losses on margin). This also means there are no deposits or fees required to participate in Phoenix.

"It would be nice if the README included use cases for a tool like this.<p>In my experience with unit testing, the process of writing the unit tests is where the most value is derived from.  It forces developers to more careful examine use cases and potential inputs for the unit under test (the latter being especially important for Python).  Therefore I would never consider something like this for testing new code.<p>The rest of the value of unit tests mostly comes from validating the scope of a change&#x27;s impact.  If a unit tests which once passed fails after I make a change, it could mean my change affected some other part of the code in a way I did not expect.  But in my experience it usually just means I overlooked something in the test suite - not that I broke something in the software itself.  Auto-generated unit tests might be useful for validating the scope of a change&#x27;s impact on old code, but I&#x27;d expect most failures to boil down to issues with the tests not getting updated correctly.<p>Where I imagine auto-generated unit tests being particularly useful is for ensuring functionality is not affected when working on bug fixes, security patches, optimizations, cruft busting, or simple refactoring.",CivBase,2021-06-01 15:36:36+00:00,comment

Those formats assume that lower bits of longer distances are essentially random, so if this assumption doesn&#x27;t hold those bits will affect the efficiency. Zstd also recommends the minimum window size of 8 MB, which is an improvement but also not very large.<p>I&#x27;ve done a quick experiment with a directory hanging around my temporary folder that weighs about 14 MB (Android CellBroadcastReceiver source code, if you ask).

"The value of a currency is a measurement of the faith of people holding it. That&#x27;s all it is.<p>If people have no faith in a currency, they&#x27;ll drop it like bad habit. If people have a ton of faith in a currency, they&#x27;ll hoard it like crazy.<p>Everything you buy with a currency is, again, a decision you make based upon faith. You have _faith_ that a house will be a good place to live, that it&#x27;ll provide for your needs and maybe be worth more in the future. Of course there are _reasons_ for this - and i can understand you objecting to me claiming that it&#x27;s just faith.  Reasons are great, for sure,  because  we&#x27;ve found that faith which is contradicted by all reason tends to fail.  The reasons we have, though, are entirely historical. I have faith that the sun won&#x27;t explode tomorrow. My _reasoning_ for this is based upon my understanding of the physics of stars and which ones explode and which ones don&#x27;t, but i recognize that i may be wrong. That&#x27;s faith.

If he thinks &#x27;well i dont think it&#x27;ll be worth anything, but i&#x27;m sure other people will think it does&#x27;  then he has faith that it will have value in the future - because other people having faith in it confers value to it.<p>Bitcoin is powered by the blockchain.

"That line of argument is part of examining religion as a social phenomenon using ideas of non-genetic evolution. The idea is that you can find evolutionary processes at play that are not a consequence of genes. It's a theory explaining parts of sociology with evolutionary biology/zoology. This is a actually an area where he <i>is</i> a leading expert.<p>As an example, Richard Dawkins coined the term 'meme' which is a term describing a gene equivalent for social traits. 'Memetics' often ends looking at religion for various reasons (availablitlity of data for one). His focus (obsession) with religion is not incidental.

"Quite interestingly, the axioms mathematics is build upon do <i>not</i> let you decide every question that you might come up with. As such in mathematics not everything is black or white. For example, the continuum hypothesis is <i>independent</i> of the most commonly used axiom system <i>ZFC</i>. To explain what that means imagine ZFC would be describing an apple. Out of the definition of &quot;apple&quot; you can get theorems that tell you &quot;if you start on any point of the apple and dig down in a straight line, at some future point in time you will reach the &#x27;other side&#x27; of the apple&quot; or some statements you can disprove &quot;if you walk on the surface of the apple in a straight you will never come back to point where you started&quot;. What you will not get is the colour of the apple. Everything you know about the apple is consistent with it being green. But all that is also consistent with it being red. The colour of the apple is independent of everything that you are interested in in an apple. Therefore there is no reasonable answer to the question &quot;which colour does the apple have&quot;, except maybe: It should not matter. The same is true of the continuum hypothesis. I remember reading that if you need the CH to prove something, then you should definitely reconsider the statement you are trying to prove :).",Perseids,2013-10-13 22:45:42+00:00,comment

"Wasm is too high level to implement your own tail calls. The WASM virtual machine handles the call stack  &amp; function calling convention, instead of being something that the code itself is responsible for. This means that the compiler can&#x27;t implement tail calls; WASM doesn&#x27;t allow a jump instruction in one function to jump into a different function.<p>There are a bunch of reasons why WASM was designed to be higher level than native assembly. One is that they want it to be more compact to save bandwidth when downloading via the internet. Another is that they want to make it faster to compile down to native code; one way they do this is that the control flow is more structured, for example it forbids irreducible control flow graphs. There is also the matter of safety. WASM defines several validation constraints that are checked before the bytecode is run e.g.: the target of a jump instruction must be listed in labels list. If WASM were too low level, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to do the safety checks they want.",ufo,2022-07-12 15:14:27+00:00,comment

"I hate these stupid &quot;my db is better than whatever db&quot; articles.
1) What db to be used depends on the situation 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY
2) what experience your staff has<p>I can say that 10 years go, I would have chosen M$SQL over MySQL and it would have been the correct choice. At the time I had almost 10 years experience with M$SQL and almost none with MySQL. Now I have more than 10 years of MySQL under my belt. AND the MySQL experience is more current. Right now I could choose between the two based on specific features and performance characteristics. For me to pick Posgresql because of a specific feature would be insane because I don&#x27;t experience with it. No knock on Posgresql ... maybe I&#x27;ll spend time with it and pick it for some down-the-road project.<p>I have implemented couchdb as a caching solution. I know how to manage, backup, and restore the database server. I have managed a 5 node cluster. If you ask me to implement NoSQL, it would be my choice for 2 reasons:
1. It can do the job.
2. I have experience making it do the job.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are 10 million people out there would would choose mongo in the same situation.

"Counterpoint: Between January 18th and Feb 17th, Wind power generation dropped 93%, coal generation rose 47%, natural gas generation rose 450% and nuclear dropped 26%. &quot;Wind turbines at times this month [February] have generated more than half of the Texas power generation, though this is only about a quarter of the system’s power capacity.&quot;<p>From WSJ: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;texas-spins-into-the-wind-11613605698"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;texas-spins-into-the-wind-11613...</a><p>By the numbers, we lost wind energy, tried to make up for it with natural gas, and weren&#x27;t able to do so, because we had become too reliant on wind. In other words, there is a strong argument that our power issues here in Texas may be blamed, not on &quot;Texas&#x27; Drive for Energy Independence&quot; but on the Federal Government&#x27;s drive for replacing fossil fuels. I&#x27;m not against green energy, but it&#x27;s quite clear that wind is not ready or consistent enough to switch to, and likely won&#x27;t be until we have large-scale energy storage mechanisms (that are not burned in order to retrieve said energy). Just by the numbers mentioned above, it&#x27;s quite clear where the lack of power generation last week came from, and it wasn&#x27;t simply a matter of not being connected to other grids. Other grids may have helped, but the shortfall came from wind.<p>The linked article makes mention of windmills icing up, and that there are ways of preventing that on Texas windmills, and that is true. And it also makes mention of the fact that the storm we just had truly was a freak storm, and not something that we really could have expected. But nevetheless, the article is nakedly hideously political, with the even-handedness being little more than a fig-leaf of their agenda: namely that the &quot;&#x27;Republic of Texas&#x27; ethos&quot; is &quot;a devastating liability&quot; in their formulation.",Gollapalli,2021-02-23 05:18:22+00:00,comment

</code></pre>
Background from Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  On MicroStrategy&#x27;s quarterly earnings conference call in July 2020, Saylor announced his intention for MicroStrategy to explore purchasing Bitcoin, gold, or other alternative assets instead of holding cash. The following month, MicroStrategy used $250 million from its cash stockpile to purchase 21,454 Bitcoin.

  MicroStrategy later added $175 million of Bitcoin to its holdings in September 2020 and another $50 million in early December 2020. On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it had sold $650 million in convertible senior notes, taking on debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion worth. On December 21, 2020 MicroStrategy announced their total holdings include 70,470 bitcoins purchased for $1.125 billion at an average price of $15,964 per bitcoin. Saylor, who controls 70% of MicroStrategy&#x27;s shares, dismissed concerns by observers that the move is turning MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin investment firm or exchange-traded fund (ETF).</code></pre>",_hdap,2021-01-04 01:48:05+00:00,comment

If Opera had more marketshare, it could&#x27;ve afforded to not keep up (though then we&#x27;d have articles about how Opera is the new IE!). I think, however, site compatibility was less about marketshare in later years and more about ancient incompatibilities (percentages rounding down, keyboard events, range events, selection, document loading&#x2F;unloading) that were increasingly important in an increasingly dynamic web.

Try to imagine a scenario in which a couple stays married 30 years, but wouldn&#x27;t have if it weren&#x27;t illegal for one partner to pay for sex, does that sound like a likely scenario to you? One might argue that people would be less likely to marry out of desperation, or that equalizing sexual options across the board increases people&#x27;s likelihood to treat their partners well. If anything you&#x27;d get a smaller number of marriages that more often last, and that&#x27;s speculation, but it is the most reasonable speculation.<p>&gt; The questions are whether you think it&#x27;s appropriate for the law to have an opinion about these things, whether you think the current law is effective, and whether you think the current law infringes on people&#x27;s liberty too much.<p>Yes, I believe this was the question you were responding to.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obvious that we can afford to stop enforcing laws that are essentially about guiding people to avoid bad choices<p>Really?

"I think the argument is that &quot;experiences&quot; can be just another form of consumerism. You&#x27;ve replaced buying stuff with buying &quot;experiences&quot;. But that&#x27;s the great thing about experiences - they don&#x27;t have to cost any money at all. A backyard campfire with friends, beer, and good conversation is just as memorable as a meal at a restaurant. And way cheaper to boot.<p>Some of my most cherished experiences have cost a lot. Others have cost very little. It&#x27;s clear that the value of an experience is entirely unrelated to how much we spend on it. The key to avoiding lifestyle inflation is selecting more of the cheaper memorable experiences.<p>The purpose of accumulating wealth (not necessarily into old age) is to have security and freedom.

"Since people are already advising you to ditch the meetings, I'll just answer with a direct tip.<p>Try sending out an email detailing the meeting's goals, agenda, and any preparation you expect from the participants. This is sometimes called GAP and I had a coworker who was a bit of a task master who'd come from a company with the policy that you didn't have to go to any meeting that didn't provide this. I like the sentiment, at least, that meetings require preparation.<p>So for a weekly meeting you might send:
Goal: To assign work responsibilities for the week
Agenda: 
* Keeping our promise to deliver X to customer Y
* Assigning bug #123
* etc.
Preparation: Could everyone come prepared with the state of their work?<p>In my experience, the preparation part is the part most likely to fail. Either the meeting planner isn't the type of personality to enforce it or the meetings aren't important enough for the participants to actually do the prep.

"Looking at this thread is why we need tools that let us structure code the way ""WE"" like it, but that outputs said code in a defaulted format.<p>Basically IDE formatting should be outside of the actual code formatting allowing people to format code how they see fit. Some are going to like to see the code the ""standards"" way and that's fine; Many of us will not.<p>@tmoertel's point is a prime example of this, as the only relationship I personally see in the aligned code is that they are all variables. His perceived parallelism was not present in my personal view of that same code snippet. Now for me white-space denotes parallelism more poignantly than alignment.<p><pre><code>  var  x                  = shape.left(),

<i>meh, I give up trying to format this code block. :P<p></i>*This denotes parallels between variables to me. Not the alignment.<p>The only parallel that is draw for me is that all the items are variables (this would also be reinforced by the color I give variables). I group things with white-space; so that means in the context of the function using the variables as I've laid them out above; x,y are related and most likely linked, where numSides is needed but not necessarily associated inside the function with the x,y variables.<p>So ya, this stuff is very subjective and as @tmoertel said ""subtle and tricky"".<p>O.",orillian,2013-05-17 17:07:48+00:00,comment

"<i>Furthermore, even if Iran does make WMDs, they do not pose a serious threat to Israel or the United States. Their delivery systems (missiles/rockets) are very antiquated and can be reliably intercepted and a suitcase nuke has extraordinary low yield.</i><p>This is incredibly naive.  A simple ship sailing into NY harbor could easily deliver a nuclear weapon, even if it was large and unrefined.  This is especially the case for a U235 gun-type (ie Little Boy) weapon, which requires relatively little sophistication.<p><i>And even if they somehow gain the capability to effectively use their WMDs they would not do so due to MAD.</i><p>Nobody would fly airplanes into a buildings because human beings want to live, right?",stickfigure,2011-07-16 03:53:14+00:00,comment

"How to get over shyness:<p>1) Take up some kind of partner dancing as a hobby eg. salsa, swing, etc.  It doesn't matter as long as it looks like fun.  This will force you to connect with people and push your comfort limits.<p>2) Start going to social dances after you know a few moves.  Usually the class teacher will be able to tell you where you can dance socially.  This will get you in the habit of asking women for dances.<p>3) To make friends, you need to invite people to do things away from the place you know them from.  So if you meet someone you seem to get along with, say something like ""Hey, I'm thinking of going to see this movie this weekend.  You interested?""  Since you've been asking women to dance, this should be much easier by this time.<p>And don't think you won't meet programmers dancing.  I once asked my teacher once why so many of the regular guy dancers were programmers or accountants.  She said that it wasn't just limited to my city but all over the world, programmers and accountants make up a disproportionate amount of the male dancers.",mattm,2011-07-07 05:39:54+00:00,comment

"&gt; You still need the IT team to babysit the AWS infrastructure. … it only ever works if you pretend that AWS lives up to its zero-management hype.<p>Who is saying zero-management? If you have a consultant lying to you, that&#x27;s not a cloud problem and I&#x27;ve heard the same people lie about all kinds of on-premise services as well.<p>What I&#x27;ve heard the major cloud providers say is true: you need _less_ staff and you can spend time on different things, which has been generally true. For example, instead of needing to configure a bunch of network hardware (which is a distinct skill you need to hire) you can have a general devops person use Terraform to manage routes, firewall rules, etc. without also needing to be a Cisco expert and spending time operating the underlying hardware.<p>The key question to ask is where your infrastructure was to start with. If you have an A-grade ops team, a lift-and-shift will probably not be much of a cost savings because you presumably already have economies of scale working in your favor, unless you have enough bursty workloads to pay for it that way. The catch is that most places do not have that high-end ops capacity so what you&#x27;re really doing is taking your limited IT capacity and reclaiming the time which is currently going into things like managing Dell firmware updates.",acdha,2021-12-14 16:50:11+00:00,comment

"&gt; Its a net negative result for affected citizens due to underhanded tactics by US<p>Net negative compared to the counterfactual of perfect interventions or the counterfactual of no interventions?<p>Again, I think there were lots of cases in which the US screwed up.  That&#x27;s easier to tell in hindsight in some of those cases.  On the ground at the time, was it obvious that the Korean War was a good idea and the Vietnam War a bad one?  (I think it _did_ become obvious that the Vietnam War was a bad idea quite a bit before the US actually pulled out of it; again, I won&#x27;t claim that the US didn&#x27;t make preventable mistakes!)<p>What I don&#x27;t have a good handle on is what the world would look like if the US post WWII had adopted the sort of foreign policy it had in 1910 or 1925 and just minded its own business and ignored the rest of the world.  And if you&#x27;re not suggesting it should have done _that_, then I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re suggesting, exactly.<p>&gt; Which is why USA is no more a world leader.<p>Is the USA less of a world leader than in the 1920s or 1930s?  I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Is it less of one than it was in 1946?  Maybe, but that was inevitable, for at least two obvious reasons:<p>1)  Its economic influence decreased as its share of world GDP dropped (which it _had_ to; in 1946 a lot of the rest of the world&#x27;s industrial capacity was in ruins, and let&#x27;s not get started on the service sector in most of 1946 Europe, Japan, China, USSR).  Also, the dependence of other countries on US exports or aid dropped from 1946 to now, generally speaking.  This is, of course, a good thing.<p>2)  The rest of the world caught up to the US in some areas in which it had had moral leadership, thus decreasing the moral leadership aspect.  As one example, the non-communist European countries which hadn&#x27;t done so yet finally got around to introducing women&#x27;s suffrage (Belgium 1948, France 1944, Greece 1952, Italy 1945, Liechtenstein 1984, Portugal 1976, San Marino 1959, Spain 1976, Switzerland 1971 or 1991 depending on how you count).<p>Which countries would you consider to be more &quot;world leaders&quot; than the US at the moment?  Or is your claim that the US is no longer _the_ world leader (as if it ever were)?  I would say that&#x27;s a very good thing.<p>&gt; Spying even the heads of states of allies<p>Do you seriously believe that the US is the only country doing that?  I would be quite shocked if this were the case.<p>&gt; Then read it as if you are from ussr.<p>I _am_ from the USSR (back when there was one).  So yes, I have some idea, both from my reading and from talking to people of my parents&#x27; and  grandparents&#x27; generation of what things looked like from that side.  A bit from personal experience as well, but that covers a somewhat small slice of post-WWII history of the USSR.<p>&gt; What I would strongly advocate for is open governance.<p>Do you mean <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_government"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_government</a> or something else?

"I&#x27;m torn on this. I&#x27;ve spent nearly the last 20 years in some form or another in academic&#x2F;research computing.<p>On the one hand, attitudes like the third reviewer&#x27;s are a primary reason for the state of HPC today, where new advances in research are just as often finding a way to run 30 year old code on a modern supercomputer as they are writing new software to take advantage of the fantastic array of new hardware. The number of times you hear &quot;sorry, we can&#x27;t change that. Livermore wrote that 15 years ago, and nobody knows how to change it anymore&quot; is enough to drive a rational person over the edge.<p>On the other hand, the state of academic peer review being what it is, I don&#x27;t fault the reviewer for suggesting the paper be resubmitted using more common methodology. A conscientious reviewer has a lot of papers to review, and spends a good amount of time on the ones that aren&#x27;t written by crackpots. While the author was of course fully in their rights (and may even have advanced the field) to use their own software written in a relatively uncommon language, for the results and methodology to be understood, that&#x27;s asking a lot of a reviewer.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely unsure as to how I would have responded to the review request.

I mean, I get that you see Dave's post as constituting an attack of sorts on Marissa, and that you think playing the vengeance card here is supported.  But not everybody saw what he wrote as particularly negative towards Marissa, and many (most) of us got that the real point he was making was contained at the very end of the original post, and were quite content to argue that point.<p>There's just no need for using HN comments to launch some sort of personal vendetta against Dave Winer (or anybody else) over something in a blog post.<p>If you have some sort of personal grudge against the man, email him and challenge him to a pistol duel at high-noon, or something.

"While superb logistics are not unique to Amazon it is just one factor that combined with other mostly non-unique factors creates a very unique and hard to duplicate advantage:<p>1) The marketplace - Amazon's website are massive marketplaces with tons of sellers, millions of customers, tons of reviews, etc.
2) Third party seller network - Amazon has thousands of people that sell on its site.  This results in lower prices, more selection, and more money for Amazon when they take their cut.
3) Fulfillment - Yes Amazon has logistics but it also has Fulfillment by Amazon.  Third party sellers can send Amazon their inventory.  Amazon charges them 'rent' for this.  Plus Amazon does not have to take inventory risk on that item yet it is still available to customers 'within 24 hours'.  And to top it off Amazon still gets their cut of the sale.<p>And the one ring to bind them all:
4) Prime - a  shipping subscription to keep people looking at Amazon before anyone else.<p>Any one of these alone is a great thing to have and several companies do -<p>Ebay and Craigslist have a marketplace and third party sellers but they don't have a fulfillment network. This fundamentally limits the customer experience they can achieve.<p>Walmart has a marketplace and a fulfillment network but their third party network is in its infancy.  It will take years to work out how they merge catalogs and can deal with fraud issues and the like.<p>FedEx and UPS have fulfillment and programs to store your inventory but they lack the marketplace to sell on.  UPS customers will still end up selling on Amazon giving Amazon a cut of the sale.  Plus using Amazon's fulfillment gets your inventory available to customers faster and usually results in more sales.<p>Prime is a major competitive advantage that pretty much no one else can offer.  You aren't going to buy a subscription to Barnes &#38; Noble or Best Buy.  I've heard of some companies trying to band together and offer a shipping subscription.  I'm doubtful that without very tight integration they can make that profitable.<p>That isn't to say no one can catch up (Walmart is probably the closet) but I think we're looking at decades of dominance.",leef,2011-12-15 08:02:11+00:00,comment

Their best bet is to partner with Tesla or another combustion based car maker.
They speak of patents - that needs to be tested on a bench to confirm it.
Tesla has many many patents that they share on a mutual basis - which means I share mine if you share yours. So if some car make wants to sign and exclusive with Linear Labs they may get cut off from the Tesla patents??
If someone is too greedy they will find no buyers as the old ways work fine.

This doesn't necessarily mean that they are biased by the money and power, but it does mean you should treat grant funded scientists with the same level of skepticism that you would treat Exxon funded scientists (that is, if there actually were Exxon funded scientists, unfortunately, the defense has decided to not show up the case).<p><i>This is often asserted, but is it true? Most alarmism that I have seen is coming from the media or activist organizations; the few times I've seen scientist alarm has been when recent measurements have been worse in some way than their models predict.</i><p>The typical modus operandi is that every time a ""climate scientist"" finds a shred of evidence that confirms their view, they run to the NYTimes with dire warnings.  But every time their is evidence going the other way, they either hide it ( <a href=""http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=345&#38;filename=1059664704.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=345&#38;filen...</a> ) or lie about it ( <a href=""http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/11/024995.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/11/024995.php</a> ).  Thus the layman reading only the NYTimes keeps hearing that ""recent measurements have been worse than predicted"", despite that there are dozens of other data points going the other way.<p><i>Further, let's assume the funding relationship is true. Are all these scientists that dishonest? Wouldn't honest ones be reigning in their colleagues? Why haven't we seen this?</i><p>First, they are not completely dishonest.  It is not a conspiracy.  It is a scientific theocracy.  They are true believers.  But if history shows anything, priesthoods are very common, even among smart, well meaning people.<p>And yes, there are dissenters. For instance, a bunch of scientists criticized the IPCC reports saying, ""Finally, while the IPCC enlists many expert reviewers, no indication is given as to whether they disagreed with some or all of the material they reviewed. In previous IPCC reports many expert reviewers have lodged serious objections only to find that, while their objections are ignored, they are acknowledged in the final document, giving the impression that they endorsed the views expressed therein."" and produced their own summary report.  Read it here: <a href=""http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/ispm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/ispm.html</a><p>But because the priesthood controls the peer review and grant process, most of the dissenters are either tenured professors like Richard Lindzen, or completely independent people like Steve McIntyre.<p>Occaissionally, you will get someone on the inside to write something very brave: ""But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere -and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now- editors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations,even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed. In this atmosphere, Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the 'politically correct picture'. Some, or many issues, about climate change are still not well known. Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture. I had the 'pleasure' to experience all this in my area of research."" <a href=""http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:ww6XwH5p28wJ:coast.gkss.de/staff/zorita/myview.html+http://coast.gkss.de/staff/zorita/myview.html&#38;cd=1&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:ww6XwH5p28wJ:coast.gkss...</a><p><i>They're expected to present and defend their claims in the court of public opinion and in the realm of politics; why are you shocked and appalled that they are doing so?</i><p>Well, it's not supposed to be their job.  Their job is to present a full and balanced view, it's the job of policy makers to make the policy.<p>But of course that's not the case.  My real problem is that newspapers and people like you still treat these scientists as unbiased experts, rather than as expert witnesses for the prosecution.  Listen to what they say, but don't treat the fact that there is a consensus as evidence that they are right.  Of course all the expert witnesses for the prosecution are going to be of the same mind.<p><i>Sure. So does astrophysics, evolutionary biology, ... How is the situation different from any other deep speciality?</i><p>The advantage other sciences have is that their theories can be proven or disproven on a short time scale.  Either your rocket works or it doesn't.  Your medicine either kills people or saves them.  Thus you have independent verification and falsifiability.<p>The area of sciences that are not subject to these forces tend to diverge from reality very quickly, see: macroeconomics, string theory, most nutrition research, etc.<p><i>So all we hear about is a ""consensus"" when that consensus is really just a self-replicating group of believers.</i><p>There is no shortcut other than to either look closely at the science yourself, or else find individuals that you really trust, and follow their opinion.<p>I haven't looked deeply into the actual science.  But the amount I have looked into it raises an enormous number of questions.  For a layman's summary of the main issues with the science, read the report above, and read these:<p><a href=""http://commentlog.org/bid/4409/The-Case-for-Global-Warming-Skepticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commentlog.org/bid/4409/The-Case-for-Global-Warming-S...</a><p><a href=""http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/11/caspar-and-the-jesus-paper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/11/caspar-and-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1579"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1579</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebits.com/FittingElephants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebits.com/FittingElephants</a>",bokonist,2009-12-07 19:02:55+00:00,comment

"&gt; Second, it is ~10% faster... &gt; It potentially uses less memory...<p>&gt; Yeah, I think you are understating it to say the least.<p>I actually measured it. It was 10% faster with a call to &#x27;r.append&#x27;, and within 0.1% with the append lookup hoisted out of the loop, on 1000 external iterations over 50,000 list items, minimum of 3, inconsistent which version was faster. my scanned function was def f(x,y): return max(0,x+y)<p>&gt; You get the exact same semantics. For most cases (including the one you cited), the alternate semantics are actually better, more flexible, and avoid requiring a list to be built in the first place.<p>range() on Python3 is not a list, and the original works on it and yet you needed scan_wrapper(). I didn&#x27;t try to fix it - I just tried to use your version and stumbled on the differences.<p>&gt; but that is still likely to be more memory efficient because it isn&#x27;t having to reallocate&#x2F;resize&#x2F;copy increasingly larger lists throughout the execution.<p>Instead you allocate a generator state each time. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in practice (I&#x27;ve measured) - the python lists grow exponentially, so we have e.g. 20 allocations+copies instead of 1,000,000 generator state allocations. I would have expected the list to be faster - but there&#x27;s no measurable difference.<p>&gt; As I mentioned, you can do the recursive solution as well, and it has the advantage of working with old Python. Still simpler and still far more efficient (here it is with extra wrapping to keep the semantics the same):<p>Recursive takes about 10 times more memory. Seriously - no TCO means call stacks are not free. Instead of one object which I stored, you store about 10 in each call frame!<p>But yes, your latest version is the idiomatic preferred version style, IMO: it&#x27;s also the most efficient. (And unlike the earlier python3 functional, it doesn&#x27;t need a helper to fix the INPUT)<p>&gt; You say that like when doing statistical analysis space-efficiency isn&#x27;t a concern...<p>Of course it&#x27;s a concern. I&#x27;m not saying it is not useful, I&#x27;m saying it is overrated, especially when compared to recursive solutions, which -- in python -- cost about 10 times more in stack space then you save in list space.<p>&gt; I was just trying to express it as tersely as possible, which unsurprisingly became Python 3 and a functional style mechanism.<p>... and taking much more memory in the process, though believing that you are using less. Not blaming you - python overlooks these things. One of K&#x27;s nice features is that the costs are mostly evident on a cursory look.<p>&gt; I think in this case it is very idiomatic Python (particularly since they defined &quot;yield from&quot; specifically for cases like this), and the code is very simple, readable, and easier to verify for correctness.<p>The recursive functional version is speedwise comparable, and spacewise much less efficient than my (admittedly, stupid) version. It is easier to prove formally, but harder to debug with a debugger because of the generator stack (which is a call stack, even though it does not exhaust the C call stack like regular calls do).<p>Can we agree that your latest scan(), if we dropped the two lines that have &quot;scan_helper&quot; in them, is the most efficient, most idiomatic, most (py2 and py3) compatible and clearest?",beagle3,2014-10-19 11:18:04+00:00,comment

"&gt; Yet no other market seems to operate by supplying only luxury units and depending on trickle down. Why are there Corollas, instead of just more Lexuses?<p>Because no other market has fixed unit quotas set by the local government[1].  There&#x27;s no rule about how many Lexuses and Corollas Toyota is allowed to build.<p>The dirty secret of the Bay Area housing market is that a lot of Lexus buyers have started buying Corollas because there aren&#x27;t nearly enough Lexuses to go around.  They can afford to pay Lexus prices for the Corolla, so they do.<p>But that means Corollas now cost as much as a Lexus.

"&gt; ... and the article you link to, seems like complete nonsense to me, and your snarky recommendation to &quot;read up on what a store of value is&quot; is silly.<p>Just to be clear, my point was that the classical definition of a &quot;store of value&quot; isn&#x27;t something that goes up exponentially and flails around wildly at the whims of folks trying to liquidate leveraged positions.<p>It&#x27;s broadly regarded as something you can purchase and expect to get your money back. Not a ton more, not a ton less, roughly what you put in. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single world in which any cryptocurrency falls into that definition today. Might it? It could.

(vs bonds or some other appreciating asset)<p>Modern economies intentionally split long-term stores of value from short-term medium of exchange. Currencies are inflated slowly to incentivize investment, and to maximize employment along the Philips curve. This is the charter of the Federal Reserve and most other world central banks.<p>&gt; Just what. Bitcoin is strictly positive sum under any sane definition. Unlike MLMs or pyramid schemes, Bitcoin never alleges to return anything other than Bitcoin.<p>It doesn&#x27;t allege a return, however literally every frothing at the mouth holder of crypto will allege it for you, as they are incentivized to do. Bring in more people, you get wealthier. Sound familiar? It&#x27;s a decentralized MLM. It&#x27;s negative-sum because miners constantly extract $60 million dollars per day, $21B per year in block rewards. These are liquidated and cause negative price pressure, socializing what amounts to a $250 transaction fee. [1]<p>&gt; Neither do currencies. They&#x27;re just currencies.<p>Which is why they don&#x27;t go up in value. You can&#x27;t have it both ways :) dreadful currencies go up astronomically in value, because this creates a deflationary spiral. Dreadful currencies go down a ton in value because it doesn&#x27;t offer you time to productively allocate. A good currency averages a low, predictable rate of inflation.<p>&gt; ... tamper-proof ledger is useful, and thus has &quot;intrinsic value&quot; just like toilet paper or gold.<p>We have yet to find a single use for it.

Drive times are reasonable - half an hour will get you pretty much anywhere, unless you do something like live at the very south end of the valley and work downtown.<p>It&#x27;s a university town, with an educated population.  There&#x27;s a very good children&#x27;s hospital.  (The zoo&#x27;s kind of dinky, though.)<p>Despite its reputation, yes, you can get a drink here.  There are some pretty good (even award-winning) brewpubs.<p>The religious aspects sometimes drive me nuts.  The air pollution can be moderately bad at times (not bad by LA standards, and not even as bad as it was in the 70s, but still worse than I like).  And it&#x27;s not really uncrowded, at least by my standards.  (A million people is a million people, no way around it.  But it&#x27;s like 2 million for the whole state, and it&#x27;s a pretty big state.)  There&#x27;s some crime downtown, and the homeless can be problematic, but it&#x27;s nothing like SF or LA.

"The value of a college education has been vastly inflated. People have associated a college education, often in nebulous useless subjects, with upwards social mobility but the truth is most should never have gone to college - i.e. side step the debt, headed directly for work or vocational training and got a 4 year head start in the job market. It&#x27;s sad when people wash up like this, and the fault isn&#x27;t theirs, rather they&#x27;ve just been sold a false promise. Taken together with the free speech and ideological eco-chamber issues we&#x27;re seeing on campus, along with the crazy town crippling debt, my prediction is we&#x27;re going to start to see a rapid devaluation in the cultural collateral of a college education.

"We&#x27;re putting a lot of faith in tools that can best be described as immature. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s out of the question to get A.I. (not speaking of Watson, which is A.I. adjacent) to the point where it can perform perfectly at human intelligence tasks. The point is to have these systems perform better than their human counterparts (at least, I think that should be aim for something like Watson for Health). The people who built these things are learning themselves. As we make more progress in technology and AI, I don&#x27;t doubt that we could break that barrier. There may be an upper limit because maybe the human brain is incapable of solving some problems, but even there I think it&#x27;s not difficult to imagine workarounds. Simply put, I don&#x27;t think the answer is to think these problems could never be solved.<p>Additionally, human-assisted A.I. is not the solution, it&#x27;s a non-answer to the problem of creating systems that can think and perform at human levels of intelligence. It&#x27;s okay to admit if we don&#x27;t have the ability to make these things, but its disingenuous to believe that human involvement in helping computers get to the right answer is the right answer.

Any disgruntled group which sees itself as the underdog against a very powerful entity will resort to terrorism.

Create embargoes on countries and organizations funding these organizations.

"Because you can&#x27;t control what the model is going to output in response to a query. The model is trained to respond in a way that is aligned but there is no guarantee.<p>Since we certainly don&#x27;t want to show generated image of porn or violence to someone that didn&#x27;t specifically ask for that, the easiest way to ensure that&#x27;s not going to happen is to just not train on that kind of data in the first place. 
The worst that can happen with a model trained on &quot;safe&quot; images is that the image is irrelevant or makes no sense, meaning you could deploy systems with no human curator on the other end, and nothing bad is going to happen. You lose that ability as soon as you integrate porn.<p>Also with techniques like in-painting, the potential for misuse of a model trained on porn&#x2F;violence would be pretty terrifying.<p>So the benefits of training on porn seems very small compared to the inconvenience. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything to do with puritanism, it&#x27;s just that if I am the one putting dollars and time to train such a model I am certainly not going to be taking on the added complexity and implications of dealing with porn to just to make a few people realize their fetishes at the risk of my entire model being undeployable because it&#x27;s outputting too much porn or violence.",Voloskaya,2022-08-15 17:34:01+00:00,comment

"&gt;The world was ready for a replacement for SVN<p>the world was ready for SVN replacement before the SVN :) SVN was a band-aid, a stop-gap multi-repo measure on top of CVS.

"Demand and production of oil are relatively coupled throughout history and both have stayed relatively flat in the west (with substantial caveats, below). So over the past 30 years, both were driven primarily by developing economies (on the demand side) and new oil discovery&#x2F;extraction techniques (on the supply side).<p><i>&gt; Besides did it double because of increased demand... or because of &quot;modern computing&quot;</i><p>My answer is basically &quot;yes&quot;. The rest of my argument contains a lot of inter-related claims, so I&#x27;m going to number them to make things easier to follow.<p>But my fundamental claim is that modern computing played a large role on both the supply side and the demand side in the oil industry over the past 30 years.<p><i>1. Effect of computing on supply:</i> Computing helped provide the steady flow of cheap oil.<p>1a. Computing enabled more efficient and more accurate discovery, driving down the price of extracting oil.<p>1b. Computing enabled new drilling techniques, driving down the price of extracting oil.<p>1c. Computing improved the efficiency of both old and new drilling techniques, driving down the price of extracting oil.<p>1d. Computing enabled improvements in refining, driving down the price of refining oil.<p>1e. Computing enabled improvements in predicting demand, decreasing the risks of destablizing cycles of under-production followed by glut.<p>2. <i>Effect of computing on demand in developed economies:</i> Computing helped decrease d(demand)&#x2F;dt for oil in developed economies.<p>2a. Fuel efficiency in vehicles -- both planes and cars -- was driven in part by modern computing. Multiple mechanisms explain this: improved design (esp in the case of cars), more efficient usage (esp in the case of planes and plants), and efficiencies directly enabled by computing (esp in cars).<p>3. <i>Effect of computing on demand in developing economies:</i>  Computing increased the rate of development.<p>3a. Indireclty: computing helped keep the price of oil more stable and lower than it would&#x27;ve been without computing (see: 1 and 2). Predictable and relatively lower prices enabled a faster rate development, which itself drove more demand. This cycle would&#x27;ve happened in any case, but by keeping prices lower and more stable, computing increased the rate of economic development inb these countries.<p>3b. Directly: In some of the most rapidly developing economies, development was <i>directly</i> driven by offshoring of IT&#x2F;computing and especially of manufacturing related to IT&#x2F;computing.<p>To conclude:<p>1. computing increased the availability and consistency of oil supply, driving down both volatility and prices (note: is is the subtle point. In the case of oil there&#x27;s a feedback loop between supply and demand, so we have to consider prices for <i>equal</i> levels of demand in the real world vs. the hypothetical no computing world. The claim is that, when we fix the level of demand, prices are significantly lower than they would&#x27;ve been without computing. The claim is not that absolute prices are lower; I think without computing, demand would be significantly lower because large swaths of the world would be significantly less developed),<p>2. computing decreased the rate of growth in demand for oil in developing economies, allowing growth in supply to enable more rapid development in other economies, and<p>3. computing increased demand for oil by both directly and indirectly driving development.<p>None of this is to discount the role of other innovations: the spread of public health practices, vaccinations, the most recent wave of globalization, relative peace, decolonization, and so on all played major roles as well. 
My point is only that, without computing, the state of oil production and consumption would be substantially different with absolutely massive implications for all of the non-western world, and perhaps for the west as well.",throwawayjava,2018-07-11 14:55:24+00:00,comment

"The article is right in the observation that Kurzweil&#x27;s singularity paper conflates a set of notions. Some are easily testable, some are more difficult to digest.<p>The notion that evolution is exponential is, to me at least, very well supported. This article criticizes the fact that Kurzweil crosses the barrier between biological evolution and technological evolution without mentioning it, and that the utility function used to plot the exponential across evolution barriers is ill-defined. Both observations are true, but I don&#x27;t think they shake the observation of exponential behaviour in these evolution functions.<p>The conclusion that this will all end in our minds being uploaded to the ether is more difficult to swallow, I concede. It <i>is</i> a philosophical can of worms, and it is a question that will be left unanswered, even <i>after</i> we can replicate human consciousness in a computer.<p>However, if you assume there is nothing magical about our brains, that our consciousness is merely the result of (biological) computation, then @AndrewDucker&#x27;s approach [1] is an easy way to wrap your head around the concept. Instead of thinking about a clicking moment when you get transferred into silicon, think of a continual transferral process, where you get silicon additions, while your organic brain continuously dies. Imagine this process takes ten years. When do &quot;you&quot; stop being &quot;you&quot;?

"TCP&#x2F;IP is the common name for the Internet Protocol Suite which UDP is part of.
Also since many mobile clients tend to issue requests over TCP (due to it being more reliable over mobile), and that many responses can be larger than 512 bytes now and EDNS is not really a standard DNS over TCP will probably over take UDP quite quickly.<p>The text below is from the RFC, and no it does not relates to zone transfers but to normal DNS queries :)<p><pre><code>   All general-purpose DNS implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP
   transport.

   o  Authoritative server implementations MUST support TCP so that they
      do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP
      packet.

   o  Recursive server (or forwarder) implementations MUST support TCP
      so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-capable
      server from reaching its TCP-capable clients.

   o  Stub resolver implementations (e.g., an operating system&#x27;s DNS
      resolution library) MUST support TCP since to do otherwise would
      limit their interoperability with their own clients and with
      upstream servers.

   Stub resolver implementations MAY omit support for TCP when
   specifically designed for deployment in restricted environments where
   truncation can never occur or where truncated DNS responses are
   acceptable.
</code></pre>
And for the most important part :P<p><pre><code>   Regarding the choice of when to use UDP or TCP, Section 6.1.3.2 of
   RFC 1123 also says:

      ... a DNS resolver or server that is sending a non-zone-transfer
      query MUST send a UDP query first.

   That requirement is hereby relaxed.  A resolver SHOULD send a UDP
   query first, but MAY elect to send a TCP query instead if it has good
   reason to expect the response would be truncated if it were sent over
   UDP (with or without EDNS0) or for other operational reasons, in
   particular, if it already has an open TCP connection to the server.</code></pre>",dogma1138,2014-12-27 16:39:40+00:00,comment

I think a lot of people are testing barcodes on iOS and have no idea that they scan poorly or not at all for other uses.  For one thing,  any camera has a minimum depth that it focuses at and if you print a QR code too small you have to hold the camera close to the code to read it and the camera can&#x27;t focus.  Another problem is that most QR code reading programs just don&#x27;t read white-on-black codes even if the standard allows them.  For that matter,  many QR code readers require much higher contrast than the standard specifies,  and even the standard is conservative compared to what is possible with a generously sized code.",PaulHoule,2021-09-29 13:53:50+00:00,comment

"<i>&gt; Of course, the real question here is whether productivity is what one should be ultimately aiming at.</i><p>This is a very good question also for the society as a whole. We are technically able to sustain the whole population with a fewer and fewer percentage of people working on holding up our living conditions (food, water, heat, housing, network communication, etc.).<p>On top of that we (as a society) create lots of bullshit work which we again try to perform as efficiently as possible. And as soon as productivity increases, we work hard to create more demand for more of the same nonsense, and if that doesn&#x27;t work anymore, we invent a new type of bullshit.<p>Why are we doing that? (Well, I&#x27;m aware of the typical cynical answer: reducing violence and crime, but there must be a better way to achieve this.)<p>What if we concentrate on improving our living conditions, and on top of that, everyone who wants to work just picks their favourite problem and tries to find a solution for it, valuing quality over being the first, valuing long-term solutions over short-term minded crap?",vog,2018-01-16 09:10:57+00:00,comment

"&gt; Does having the LLC increase your tax complexity?<p>Based on the verbiage of your question, I would simply say this isn&#x27;t something you would try to structure without tax counsel&#x2F;IRA counsel.  Note, what I am referencing is known as a self-directed IRA LLC (sometimes called a special purpose LLC).<p>If structured properly the IRA LLC should not need to file a federal tax return (it should be a single member LLC, so it is considered a disregarded for tax purposes, with the IRA being the sole member).  That said if you dip into a tax free retirement account, you will likely trigger significant taxes, so again this is where the tax counsel&#x2F;IRA counsel would guide you to avoid those potential liabilities.  There are some other potential issues with IRA LLCs concerning disqualified persons and prohibited transactions, to avoid triggering taxes (all pretty simple and navigable once you are informed and aware of the issues)",throwaway_tech,2020-01-22 16:09:35+00:00,comment

"This is a good article, but I disagree that Scrum&#x27;s major flaw is a lack of hierarchy on the development teams. I&#x27;ve worked on some great self-organizing teams, and they&#x27;re more than equal to the product manager. They outnumber the PM, after all.<p>The problem only comes in an organizational culture of &quot;whatever the boss says&quot;. In that context, teams rarely learn to self-organize. Instead, the previously existing control hierarchy stays in place. Before, developers built whatever spec landed on their desk. Now they build whatever is in JIRA. Developers in that world can&#x27;t even conceive of pushing back.<p>It&#x27;s my belief that if Scrum had had some strong counter-balance to that, like an Engineering Master, then it just wouldn&#x27;t have been adopted. Scrum won out over the other Agile processes (of which there were several) not because it produced better results, but because it was the one most comfortable for medium- and large-company managers. It provided the feeling of transformation without actually changing anything important. They were doing waterfall before, which became untenable with the rise of the Internet. Now they do mini-waterfall, call it Agile, and imagine themselves kings of the world.",wpietri,2018-05-30 13:51:33+00:00,comment

"&gt;&gt; most independent content creation does not seem to be paywalled, so people who do not have the means to support the content can still enjoy it<p>Another hypothetical scenario: I make videos of mobile phone reviews, and I&#x27;m an amazing reviewer.

"I agree with your general take on developer productivity, but I don&#x27;t feel that modern JS is significantly messier than Python, at least not to a level where it significantly impacts productivity (I&#x27;d rather avoid a debate on the abyssal depths of the language, eg, type coercion)<p>I feel about the same amount of grievances with both.

"&gt;&gt; During FB&#x27;s initial worldwide rollout, it was exciting to just &quot;friend&quot; everyone whom you had an acquaintance, because it wasn&#x27;t yet taboo or uncool to do so.<p>&gt;&gt; ideally this gets worked out in heartfelt conversations in person<p>So, you agree that<p>a) there was indeed a novelty factor at that time to reconnecting on Facebook (i.e. you were actually glad to take an action without Facebook&#x27;s constant nagging) and<p>b) you also go on to hint that your definition of weak connection is &quot;it still is only via Facebook&quot; which became strong because you moved on to have better relationships &quot;outside of Facebook&quot;<p>Neither of these things are true anymore. The Facebook of 2017 is nothing like the Facebook of about 10 years ago.<p>And most people are going in the <i>opposite direction</i> of what you are observing. Example: have you ever heard someone tell another person who doesn&#x27;t happen to be on Facebook about some major event in their life by saying &quot;Oh I did announce it on Facebook (or WhatsApp). Didn&#x27;t you see it?&quot; If you haven&#x27;t, good job, you actually selected excellent people to be friends with.<p>The &quot;friction&quot; is <i>actually the thing which makes the difference</i>.

Or the one where the student watches flashy videos and goes away feeling all gung-ho, only to realize nothing stuck?<p>Sure, you don&#x27;t want things to be harder just for the sake of being harder. And neither do you want to diss things which are lowering the friction of connecting. The problem is all the manipulation going on in the name of lowering friction.<p>If at some point you say &quot;Well, but Facebook also needs to make money&quot;, then you can already see the problem with the entire business model by your own admission. Because then you know there is no line which shouldn&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t be crossed - including selling out your already immature teenage audience.<p>Conversely, if the demand for such a connecting service is so huge, there would already be a paid alternative promising a lot of privacy in return for payment.",thr0waway1239,2017-05-02 13:57:31+00:00,comment

"It&#x27;s a trick question. The question creates doubt because it asks you to choose between two wrong options. [Edit: no, it gives all three possibilities; I speed-read through that. Thanks to others for pointing that out. However it then does predominantly focus on the question of &quot;up or down?&quot;, which isn&#x27;t the right question.]<p>Ice is lower density than water, which is why it floats. As the ice melts, the runoff from the above-surface ice will raise the water level -- but the shrinkage from the below-surface ice will lower the water level. Assuming the above-surface and below-surface ice melts at the same rate, the water level will remain unchanged.<p>(Note that if this were a glass of hot water in a cold room, then you&#x27;d get non-uniform heating of the ice. The subsurface ice would melt first, causing the level of the water to lower, until the above-surface ice melted, at which point the water level would return to its original level. On the other hand, a glass of cold water in a hot room would initially overflow while the above-surface ice melted, and then its water level would lower when the subsurface ice melted. So the answer to the original question is, depending on context, either &quot;neither&quot; or &quot;both&quot;.)",nkoren,2014-02-24 14:28:08+00:00,comment

Some men are remarkably violent, but most of them know exactly what they&#x27;re doing and they&#x27;re not controlled by an illness.<p>The prevalence of violence, and mental illness, means that obviously there&#x27;s some overlap between &quot;people who are ill&quot; and &quot;people who are violent&quot;, but you need to be really careful not to say &quot;the violent people in that overlap are violent because of their mental illness&quot;.<p>When looking at predictors of violence we see that mental illness doesn&#x27;t give you much if any predictive power.<p>Substance misuse does; previous episodes of violence does; and any (especially all) of these combined does.<p>The reason it&#x27;s important to avoid incorrectly linking violent behaviour to mental illness is seen in the stats of people shot and killed by US police: about half the people shot and killed each year are people with mental illness. The vast majority of them pose zero risk of harm to other people, maybe some risk to themselves, but they get killed because people like you keep pushing the &quot;mental illness == violent and dangerous&quot; myth.",DanBC,2017-03-31 00:35:52+00:00,comment
"This is great stuff!!!  It truly is an exciting time to be working in news/media.<p>It is absolutely the case that mixing, mashing, hacking and building are a means-of-expression as vital to news/media as words and images.<p>A key ingredient in our sauce over here at Vox Media (SB Nation, The Verge and soon Polygon) is a break with the old pattern where technology and development teams are considered (at the organization and conceptual level) to be utilities or tool providers for editorial and business initiatives.<p>Rather, we embrace what internet native reporting and story telling require: an organization and mindset where editorial, business initiatives and technology are intertwined together like some kind of triple helix.<p>This sounds like business speak but what it really is a tough challenge - one that is very exciting and one that is creating some pretty great opportunities for creative people and builders.<p>The Knight-Mozilla OpenNews initiative looks like a great a way to get involved and I very much look forward to the ideas and things this fellowship program produces.<p>Cheers!",odacrem,2012-07-23 17:16:52+00:00,comment

"That is a terrible chart.  Of course share of wealth goes up as you get older - you’ve had more time to acquire it.  They’ve attempted to adjust for age, but it’s not helpful when the oldest millennial has barely entered the workforce.<p>The chart also ignore the population share of each generation - Baby boomers made up a massive part of the US population - 70M out of a population of about 210M (1980) or 33% when they hit working age.<p>Millennials are slightly larger in numbers - 72M, but smaller part of the total of 330M (2020) or 21%.<p>Crude analysis and you’d have to assume everything else remains the same (it doesnt), but if all wealth was equally distributed by age you’d expect Millenials (of the same age) to have about 33% less <i>share of the total wealth</i> based on population alone.<p>Which isn’t far off from that chart if you assume Millennials track similar to Gen-X.",refurb,2021-10-17 02:13:07+00:00,comment

"95% of generative art is fridge art - beginner-level doodles by people who haven&#x27;t taken the time to learn anything at all about art history, art techniques, composition, colour theory, physical art media, printing techniques and technologies, art-as-culture, or even just the history of digital graphics.<p>And implementing algorithms designed by someone else doesn&#x27;t require any obvious imagination.<p>Luckily 5% (or so) of generative work is more interesting than this. But IMO there&#x27;s a huge, huge gap between the quality and imagination of the work done by people who are talented and committed enough to work on generative art for years, and the people who knock out a few doodles in Processing (or Quil, or some other system) and feel terribly pleased with how creative they&#x27;re being.<p>So no - it&#x27;s not interesting art. It&#x27;s an excuse to play with algorithms for people who enjoy playing with algorithms. This particular excuse makes graphics.

"I&#x27;ve lent people money. Friends, too. Usually that&#x27;s a tough situation. I live by the maxim that &quot;if you loan money to a friend, be prepared to lose the money or the friend.&quot; Still, you want to help your friends out, right?<p>Thing is, sometimes those friends (or other folks) have friends who enable them. Maybe it&#x27;s to go out to the bars at night or buy a new game so they can play together. It&#x27;s hard to predict what their impact will be, at least with the information most of us have to work with.<p>Now, suppose I did have a considerable amount of information, such as Facebook would. I could make more accurate predictions, but there will always be gaps. I always feel uncomfortable having personal conversations over Facebook because I always feel like someone&#x27;s looking over my shoulder. Or maybe I don&#x27;t want the communication remembered. Either way, it&#x27;s a blank spot that can&#x27;t be confirmed or denied, so it will always be an imperfect, some might say <i>discriminatory</i> measure.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the scene in Gattaca when the protagonist is born and instantly a doctor preforms a DNA test to show all the disadvantages he&#x27;s statistically likely to experience in life: asthma, ADHD, and so on.

"As others have mentioned development of reddit has been slow for the fact that their Engineering teams were performing Administrative tasks to the point that they could only maintain the site. Since they have cleared that hurdle by instituting more straightforward moderation and administration. 
The only exception to this is when a reddit admin actively modified a thread by users being hostile. This creates irreparable problems because users can&#x27;t trust the administration to not tamper with their comments. They have on record stated that they will not do this in the future but you can&#x27;t undo the removal of trust of their users. I have been a reddit user for almost 11 years and I am not associated of the group in question and it has made me loose faith in reddit.<p>Their struggles with advertisement is something they can actively address now. Before when they were smaller than digg once digg made a huge mister and alienated their users this allowed to flourish into the site it is today. Due to the fear of what occurred to Digg their advertising was less aggressive their advertisements have been less aggressive and attempt to be targeted. But, since reddit is so large now the risk of alienation is much less. Also, other condenders like imgur and voat have tried to take the throne from reddit without success. Also, they have made great strides in making it accessible to everyone and you can get anyone from any political spectrum. If reddit wants to make money they have to broaden their appeal greatly and I believe thats the purpose of the $150m. Hopefully when they do this they won&#x27;t turn out like digg because they are a much larger network now.",zitterbewegung,2017-06-17 02:46:51+00:00,comment

"&quot;A great way to get into such a fund is to apply as a software developer, with aspirations of becoming a portfolio manager&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not a path well traveled, especially at banks.

Policy may prevent you access to the interesting data sets (execution data and historical P&amp;L is sensitive to reverse engineering, and market data is often subject to expensive licensing).

Here's an example of what I mean. Nelson inserted a note in this document in 2012 wherein he points to the rise of XPointer and XPath as validating something he said back in 1999. XPointer and XPath?! XPointer and XPath have had barely any impact on <i>anything</i> that's happened in computing since 1999.<p>Nelson is apparently in such a deep fog of irrelevance that he somehow perceives XPointer and XPath as being important in some way?

"&gt;But in the bank scenario, the dollars that it loaned out aren’t worth any less.<p>Just a small point of clarification - I think - that helps to make your point a little clearer.<p>If the bank collapses - it&#x27;s likely precisely because those loaned dollars ARE worth less.  Commonly in bank collapses - those that borrowed from the bank can&#x27;t repay for whatever reason.  Creditors to the bank then get spooked and demand &#x27;redemption&#x27; of their deposits.. etc<p>The difference is that whether or not a borrower from the bank still has that wealth is mostly independent of the actions of the bank (making other risky loans that lead to collapse etc). The value of the borrowed dollars depends entirely on the borrower. Whereas with tether - you might have locked it down in a hardware wallet encased in cast iron steel under your bed - doing nothing risky with it at all - but it could still go to zero in value.  Tether&#x27;s value depends on the actions of the issuer entirely.<p>Similarly - the owners of tether can&#x27;t, through their risky use of tether endanger the prospects of the issuer; while borrowers can, through their risky use of loans, endanger the prospects of the banks.",oraphalous,2021-10-16 17:35:51+00:00,comment

"New reactors should reduce the waste produced per reactor and&#x2F;or offer ways reduce it. In general, Gen IV reactors produce far less waste per kWh. There are some theoretical MSRs, molten salt reactors, that may even be used to reduce the radioactivity of existing waste. All active nuclear power plants use LWRs, light water reactors, which need to be refueled every two years. The &quot;spent rods&quot; still have a significant amount of energy. The best Gen IV reactors require one refuel every thirty years. I believe, with enough investment and research, we will see more opportunities to not only reduce but, reuse and recycle waste. The real question is would you rather deal with waste confined to containers or waste that has been spewed into the environment.<p>There are a lot of structural issues with the current fleet of reactors. Partially because these reactors were built decades ago and have been used far past their designed lifespan. We shouldn&#x27;t equivocate the capability and issues of old nuclear with new nuclear technology.<p>Yes... solar, wind, hydro, and grid storage technology have the potential to support our power generation and distribution infrastructure. However, it isn&#x27;t realistic to  expect this within the next couple of decades. Although, we see how investment into these sectors have helped accelerate the technology. We should do the same for nuclear which is powerful, proven, and the only direct replacement for coal and oil(without upgrading the infrastructure).

"My previous company built technology in this space, based on Squid, and some custom tools.  I vividly recall competitors making bold, outlandish, claims like these on a monthly basis back then.  None of them ever came to pass.  They required too much infrastructure build out, too much cooperation from ISPs and website owners, and the companies behind them demanded too much involvement and too much money from all parties in the chain.  There was a CDN rush back then, too, and only a few managed to raise enough money and build out fast enough to be successful at it.  This kind of technology requires a build out similar to a CDN, but with far more involvement of parties that are very unlikely to have an interest in being involved.<p>I've had long conversations with folks at Akamai, Red Swoosh, and many others, in this particular area...and it's astonishing how much money it takes to build this stuff out, and finding profitable ways to build out small (making it useful enough to make money on <i>without</i> first spending millions and signing on dozens of ISPs) is very difficult.

My path to functional programming started with Paul Graham’s lisp essays and books and then SICP and Scheme. I visited the world of Haskell but only half heartedly as I was much happier in a dynamically typed world for my hobby projects. As a daytime C++ coder I found types an annoyance; so much time wasted getting something to compile. Later I came to discover types again with Scala and now I’m fully sold. I will revisit Haskell again some day but most likely will learn Elm first. Elm is a much friendlier ML style language and much more explicit about things like monads. Moving from Elm to Haskell is much easier since the programmer will have “aha” moments mapping what they did explicitly in Elm to what you can do more generically with type classes in Haskell,justinhj,2017-10-16 14:59:44+00:00,comment

"Overall it has worked very well. Simply avoid the TV for 10 minutes when there is one of the approved election broadcasts from one of the main parties. Outside of those... No sound of axes being ground.<p>Obviously the politicians try as hard as they&#x27;re able to inject party messages in every topical interview or discussion programme, but there is a requirement to seek balance so they don&#x27;t get their own way here either. Often this works well, sometimes the &quot;balance&quot; is having someone eminently unqualified to parrot &quot;no&quot; a lot. Nigel Lawson, the ex-chancellor, denying climate change springs to mind as a recent example.<p>Brexit rather broke the process.

"I&#x27;m searching for any job opportunities at larger companies that can &quot;get you back up to speed&quot; on required peripheral knowledge with some on-site training&#x2F;mentoring, provided that you can take care of most of the core knowledge yourself.

"In NZ, car insurance companies openly use location, gender and age in pricing.<p>Men under 25 pay the highest premiums due to their repeated statistically demonstrated tendency to take far more risks and accordingly have far more serious accidents.<p>(And good luck getting full insurance if you&#x27;re male, under 25 and own a vehicle with a turbo.)<p>Likewise, women 30+ get lower premiums than men because while they have more fender benders, they have far less serious crashes - and our insurance companies proudly advertise to women on that basis.<p>And your car premium will vary based on your location&#x27;s car theft rates, although how you store your car (garage vs. driveway vs. street parking) and installed antitheft devices will reduce it.<p>However, race based pricing is very much not a thing.<p>It probably could be, as a proxy for socio-economic status, as the indigenous people of NZ are over-represented in all negative socio-economic indicators, thanks to colonisation followed by about a century of government policy, some deliberate (e.g., Tohunga Suppression Act 1907), some accidental (Manpower Act 1944).<p>And poor young men are even more at risk of serious accident than other young men.<p>That said, as no insurer will pay out if your car didn&#x27;t have a current warrant of fitness (proof that your car meets minimum safety regulations), or current registration (just a tax, used to fund road maintenance and our no-fault accident insurance scheme), that effectively discriminates against poor people anyway.<p>Incidentally, NZ doesn&#x27;t have compulsory third party insurance.<p>And I strongly support that - making it compulsory only benefits insurance companies by reducing their risk (which they aren&#x27;t compelled to pass on to customers as lower premiums), and because once something is mandatory, you can charge far more than is fair, and people can&#x27;t respond like a rational market would by just not buying your service.",EdwardDiego,2022-02-27 06:35:26+00:00,comment

"That is a major factor, but there is a bigger one: the product that an insurance company will agree to sell you and the product they will agree to sell your employer are <i>not materially the same product</i>.<p>The actuarial assumption is that substantially all white collar employees will get group coverage and therefore any company&#x27;s 25, 100, or 500 pulls out of the pool of white collar employee health risks will be actuarially consistent with random selections from the underlying distribution.  This is <i>not true</i> of individual insurance purchasers, because the individual purchasers can have more signal on their health risks than their insurance companies.  They can, for example, purchase insurance when they know they&#x27;re likely going to require treatment and decline to purchase (or shift to different coverage options) when they&#x27;re likely to be healthy.<p>This is called &quot;adverse selection&quot; and it is <i>the</i> tradeoff in individual insurance.  For a while, the US&#x27;s policy was that insurance companies could underwrite individual health insurance policies in a fashion roughly similar to underwriting business liability policies, which could be caricatured as &quot;We&#x27;ll give a policy to anyone with a pulse but if you&#x27;ve so much as glanced in the general direction of an expensive outcome at any point, our answer is Hell No, just like substantially every other insurance company&#x27;s will be.&quot;<p>If you let insurance companies do underwriting, health insurance is (relatively) cheap and lots of people can&#x27;t buy it on the individual market at any price.

"It&#x27;s really hard to give good recommendations without knowing your particular circumstance but here is the thought process I have gone through around the same issue.<p>First of all, I think the standard advice of get enough sleep, eat healthy, exercise and stay within a reasonable weight (15%-20% body fat - lower if you can manage it) will solve the physical aspect of the energy equation. If any of those are off balance for you, get those sorted out. It will help you immensely in all areas of your life.<p>I also will assume you have strong motivation for working on your side-project. If it&#x27;s to hopefully launch your product, learn a new skillset or whatever, if the idea of working on it doesn&#x27;t itch in your brain all the time then sort that out. I think if you don&#x27;t have a strong internal motivation for working on your side project there is no way that you&#x27;re going to spend one hour a night, let alone four to five.<p>I&#x27;ll go with the idea that you&#x27;re trying to build a software product (let&#x27;s say some kind of SaaS). Come to peace that building the product cannot and will not have the momentum of a rabbit but will be the lowly turtle or the snail. Accept this and be ok with it.<p>I think the biggest factor of success when working on the side on something is planning beforehand. I believe to build motivation for working on the product in your free time you have to know that you are making progress and there is light at the end of the tunnel. Planning is a critical aspect of this. To achieve this, you have to put on your product manager&#x2F;architect hat and really figure out what the feature set you are building needs to be for the MVP, how much of what you are doing is going to involve learning new tech and&#x2F;or how much you can do with what you know.<p>If you can validate your idea beforehand in some concrete way it will automatically be a motivation booster. If you cannot, focus on the most basic MVP that you can go to market with and accept that it may go bust. From this a good set of development tasks can start to be developed. Put an estimate on each of these and try to come up with a rough enough of hours. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a 1000 hours of effort. Now, you can break that down into a date based on how much you can commit.<p>In terms of how much you can commit, I think we all know ourselves best. I certainly can&#x27;t work 4-5 hours on my side project on top of a full day of normal work. I also certainly don&#x27;t view those people with any kind of admiration. I need time with family, to exercise, get enough sleep, hang out with close friends, to chill, etc. and those take time. For me, I can&#x27;t neglect those things. Be true to yourself and look at your schedule. Be critical about it. Realistically, how much can you commit using the week as a guideline and not daily. Can you do 4-5 hours a week? Great, do that. Start with that. There is good possibility that you will increase your weekly hours once you see progress.<p>Assuming the 1000 hours and 4-5 hours a week, now you kind of have a target date that you can measure your progress. Take your high level development roadmap and start breaking it down to a point where you can start actual work. Break it down into steps. These can be coding, reading, design work, researching, whatever that involves the side-project.<p>Personally, for me, I use a simple markdown file, open in Vim with the following:<p># Next Steps
[ ] Item one 
[ ] Item two<p># Completed<p>Date
[x] Item three
[x] Item four<p>Date
[x] Item five
[x] Item six<p># Review as Needed
[ ] Task or design decision that is important but not relevant right now<p># Defer
[ ] Task that was part of next step but for whatever reason is deferred. Reason is provided.<p>When I am working, I will move items to the the Completed and add new items in the Next Steps near the end of the work session. I found this is the simplest and completely ceremony free. I tried Trello and other sprint planning type tools and I&#x27;m not that type. At the end of the day, you need to start working on your side project. If Trello or some other planning tool works for you then use it. For me, I realized I was wasting more time with the tool versus doing real work. The simple file gives a great overview of how much I&#x27;ve already done and when I start working again, I just look at the first line in the Next Steps and get going.<p>I think personally what has been the most effective for me is to just start working on it with a plan in place. I know that it&#x27;s going to be months before I reach my development goals but I&#x27;m ok with this. As long as I can say, that I made progress during the week however incremental, it was a good week.",avenger123,2020-07-17 06:30:48+00:00,comment

"Different Coloring Agents -
Paints and inks have different coloring agents. Paints are made up of tiny bits of colored minerals like clays or talc suspended in a colorless matrix such as polyester or vinyl. A chemical union of tannic acid and iron sulfate dissolved in water or alcohol forms the coloring agent of some inks. Others use such dyes as aniline.<p>Different Coloring Procedures - 
Ink soaks into the surface that it colors, but paints do not soak in -- they cover the surface with a coating. In fact, a primer is usually applied to the surface before painting so that the paint won't soak in. For this reason, paint sometimes chips off the surface that it covers, but this never happens in the case of ink.<p>Surface Protection - 
Paint not only colors a surface, but also provides the surface with a protective covering that will keep it from deteriorating when assailed by such agents as wind and rain. Ink offers no such protection.<p><a href=""http://www.ehow.com/facts_7225030_difference-between-ink-paint.html#ixzz2MUKSBJyN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/facts_7225030_difference-between-ink-pai...</a>",Pkeod,2013-03-03 14:46:28+00:00,comment

"For most private schools (and the more prestigious public schools), the only people who pay list price are those most able to pay it. Working class and even squarely middle-class kids will generally qualify for significant amounts of need-based financial aid in the forms of grants. So, to the degree that cost is a factor, you should be considering the tuition in conjunction with the financial aid package offered.<p>I think neither cost (as long as the cost is affordable) nor prestige should be the top criteria.<p>I think its more important to find a good match between the student and the environment of the college. The most important aspects of the environment are the professors, the other students and the available academic programs.<p>I'd discount big research universities, since the foremost criteria used by the institution for evaluating undergrad instructors is 1) are they cheap (ie grad students), 2) does their research attract prestige, funding, and cheap labor (ie grad students).  The foremost criteria used by undegrads in evaluating their profs is ""coolness"" and the ease of getting a good grade.  Also, access by undergrads to profs is limited. They are usually teach in big lecture environments, and their office hours are limited.<p>Focus more on institutions, like small liberal arts colleges, that place a high value on undergrad instruction, while still expecting profs to maintain a level of engagement in scholarship and research.  The classroom environment is usually more intimate and profs are more available outside of the classroom.<p>The students are important too. Every hour spent with a prof will also be spent with other students. Better they contribute to the experience.  Also, for every hour spent in a classroom setting, there should be at least as many spent studying and socializing with other students.<p>Even if you have your criteria firm in your mind, its hard to get enough information to base an evaluation on, so it pays to look for points of leverage among friends, family, family doctor, high school teachers, etc.  None of them are going to have good knowledge of more than one or two institutions, but teachers will have a sense of the experiences of former students. Older friends and relatives will know about their own institutions.  Parents of friends and relatives will know something about the experience of their own children, and also of the children of their own friends and family.  What's most important though is that these people will have an inside perspective not just the institutions, but on the prospective student. So, tell these people what the student is looking for, ask them for suggestions based on what they know, and then ask them why they made the suggestion they did and see if it makes sense.<p>It's also worth paying close attention to the way the schools markets themselves. If a college manages to communicate a strong and consistent identity for itself in its marketing materials then i'd give that identity some weight unless their is strong evidence to the contrary (particularly if the same message is delivered once they've issued their acceptance).  There are some perverse incentives for small schools to misrepresent themselves, but these mostly come into play before applications are received.  Also I think these perverse incentives are checked by the fact that they don't have a lot of flexibility with respect to class size.  Too many students and their quality of teaching suffers.  Too few and their finances suffer.  In addition, if its a bad match and the student drops out, it can damage their reputation, and hurt some of the metrics on which they are judged when it comes time for re-accreditation.<p>Take advantage of the net to get more of an inside view on schools too.  We used to have prospective students checking out our live journal group. I think that's died off a bit, but there are still groups on facebook and whatnot, and the school should be able to put you in touch with current students and recent grads.<p>In the end though, its great to do a campus visit, particularly if you are choosing among just a handful of schools. Arrange it with admissions.  They may get you a room for a night in a dorm, and they'll get you into classes, and give you a campus tour. Outside the formal activities, take advantage of unscheduled time to talk to other students.<p>Regarding the academic program, a lot of students end up graduating in something they might not even have known about when they entered, and they may end up making a living doing a job that didn't even exist when they graduated.  For these reasons, I think its important to get a good solid liberal education, with exposure to a variety of subjects and viewpoints no matter what major they choose, and a grounding in the humanities, so they have a perspective on the forces that have shaped society in the past, and can apply that perspective to understanding present day changes.<p>Last thing, I think the prospect of launching a startup after graduating was raised in another thread.  I generally encourage people to keep their options open after graduation by not taking on too much debt.  For a student who is planning on a pursuit (like writing a book, or starting a company) where they can expect little or no income for a long stretch after graduation, I think the goal should be graduating with no debt at all.  In those cases, cost could become a more important factor; 10K in loans might not be decisive if one expects to have some sort of paying job after graduation, but it could be the difference between having grocery money, or going to bed hungry if you are planning on scraping by while trying to get a startup off the ground.",easp,2009-01-10 22:57:06+00:00,comment

"&gt; &gt; From day one, the 2019 trip was very different from the 2018 one. The three leaders — who were with the students for a week before I joined — were different from the more apolitical “adventure tourism” leaders of the 2018 trip. The tone felt more like a big lesson in how to be an anti-colonialist and to romanticize indigenous medicine. … In 2018, some students and I spent hours trying to top each others’ bad puns.

"Can&#x27;t read the Journal article so not sure if it has this or not, but reply from Theranos:<p>This is a one-sided filing by one party to litigation, and we will respond at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum. We disagree with much of what PFM alleges in its complaint.  This is not, however, the time or place to contest their mischaracterizations of the record.  We will litigate this case in court, where it belongs.  What we will say now is that the items on which PFM focuses have nothing to do with why PFM invested, and they amount to a repackaging of allegations the media have already reported for nearly two years.<p>As for the tender offer:  As previously disclosed, Theranos is in the midst of a tender offer involving its most significant shareholders.  Elizabeth Holmes’ use of her own shares to recapitalize our C-2 and C-1 investors—and thereby prevent dilution to our other shareholders—is consistent with her longstanding, personal commitment to doing the right thing for the Theranos shareholder base. This tender offer has been in discussion between Theranos and its shareholders since July 2016.  To date, more than 99% of C-2 and C-1 investors other than PFM have chosen to participate.<p>PFM, a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, opposes the transaction, and is asking the Court to stop the tender offer because it is “unfair” specifically and only to PFM. In response  to PFM’s suit, the Court suspended the tender offer for a month in order to permit sufficient time for the court to review the transaction.  PFM’s effort to enjoin the tender offer is meritless; their legal theories are self-serving and would harm the rest of the Theranos shareholders. The Company is vigorously opposing PFM’s new suit and looks forward to completing the transaction with its shareholders.<p>From: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;theranos-says-it-has-been-mischaractarized-in-allegations-the-company-faked-tests-and-boosted-financials&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;theranos-says-it-has-been-...</a><p>There will never be enough popcorn for the Theranos saga.",tetrep,2017-04-21 20:30:18+00:00,comment

I probably put gas in every 3-4 months when I had mine.<p>At one point when I was driving the engine came on and ran simply for maintenance because it hadn&#x27;t been used for so long.<p>The only time I ever used gas was if I needed to drive out of state or across the state for holidays with the family.

"The lovely thing about English is all the nuance words we use can have :-).<p>&gt; Well back then the attorneys always had clients who were expected to engage them purely based on reputation and word-of-mouth ...<p>This is a crucial observation IMHO.<p>&gt; In business &quot;clients&quot; were the ones that came to you, &quot;customers&quot; were the ones that needed a little sales pitch.<p>And this is where we diverge in our use of &quot;clients&quot; and &quot;customers&quot; in a business context.  My use of &quot;customers&quot; is not in a retail type of context, where convincing is often needed, but is instead in a service one.<p>Perhaps the author&#x27;s phrasing of:<p>&gt; A client implies that the consultant is superior, while customer suggests that the consultant is beholden.<p>Is a bit too strong.  What if, instead, the two were categorized as;<p>- A client implies that the consultant (doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.) is sought out by someone who will do what the consultant tells them to do due to reputation and&#x2F;or word-of-mouth.<p>- A customer suggests that the consultant (doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.) is sought out by someone who needs their skills and expects the consultant to work with them to achieve their goals.<p>To me, the former cedes control to the consultant.  This is not always a bad thing, BTW, as for example many people will recommend; &quot;listen to your lawyer, they know the law and courts better than you.&quot;<p>The latter conveys to me more of a collaborative interaction, where the consultant and customer are each reminded that what the consultant offers are the skills the customer requires to reach their goals.

"&quot;the NFT hype never made any sense whatsoever to begin with&quot;<p>I felt the same, but now regard NFTs as the first meaningful application of blockchain.<p>First, let&#x27;s talk about land registries. In developed countries, the state administers a land registry. There is a strict, human-administered API against this registry. It allows users to inspect the full history of land; cause property splits&#x2F;mergers; execute land exchange; and there is capacity for extensions like water-rights and native title. There is formal governance around some of these operations - conveyancing; council approval.<p>NFTs have the potential to do something similar, initially for artwork.<p>Imagine if every time an artist created a painting, they issued a NFT against it, and got this authorised by an authority. That authority does not yet exist, but Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s could set up in this space with low effort. Each time a transfer of the artwork occurs, both the NFT and the physical artwork change ownership to the new owner.<p>This would have a snowball effect, and quickly become the new standard for provenance. Insurance companies would insist that works were marked on the exchange. A stolen artwork would be nearly worthless. It would be pointless to duplicate artwork, because the sold duplicate would effectively destroy the original.<p>Extension: firearms. Firearms are valuable goods, and would soon be forced onto this registry. Perhaps the state would encourage this transition by asking that firearms ranges mark the transition of guns to and from the range premises by marking this on the chain.<p>Extension: wine. There is a live problem in China, with rubbish wine being fraudulently marked as premium Australian varieties. Each bottle could be chipped in the cap with an on-chain identifier. In the wine shop, you could use your phone to scan the identifier, and witness custody of that wine back to the producer.<p>Evolution: complex goods. The next evolution would be to trace the grapes that went into the wine back to the vineyard that they came from.<p>Reputation becomes very important in this system. This would encourage a new type of auditing profession, who serve a similar role as conveyances, but for chain operations. Once you have that, you could mark carbon credits of goods on the chain, you could have eggs tagged as being free-range or organic, etc.",cturner,2021-06-03 11:10:24+00:00,comment

"Well put, and another aspect beyond currency is a move against centralised control of enterprise. Centralised legal systems governing contracts, centralised ownership and rewards, centralised risk, etc. Some people looked at how the world is run and thought they could make a more efficient and secure way of doing things with more freedom for anyone that can swing an IDE to create fairer reward systems.<p>At least one of the implications of systems like ethereum is that they enable autonomous contracts that are decentralised and at least in theory don&#x27;t require any separate and typically centralised governing body to execute and enforce, which could in turn lead to a range of new models of business and human interaction.<p>It remains to be seen what will happen, the technology is still young (the Web took about a decade to start catching on in the mainstream as perhaps being something more than a flash in the pan) and lofty ideas are being thrown at the wall as the new concepts are explored in both good and bad ways.<p>Having seen the ups and downs of the online revolution I have a hunch at least some of it will stick, and whether this moment goes down as some great proletarian revolution or becomes just another tool in the billionaires belt seems up in the air to me, but at the very least it is disruptive and we may be seeing the birth of the next generation of crypto barons.<p>Or anything could happen, like by some unlikely turn of events we solve prime factorisation and the whole thing fizzles into history as a big oops moment, or jackbooted forces raid homes and data centres to destroy all crypto-related hardware and knowledge.<p>I feel the outcome will be somewhere between the two extremes of utopia and dystopia, it just seems to be how things turn out, but as you say at least people are trying things.

"I'm not saying Anaya wasn't an idiot — even willfully so — or that he shouldn't have been charged under <i>California</i> statute on traps and their being used to transport narcotics. The issue in his case isn't that he wasn't guilty of a crime; it's that he wasn't guilty of a <i>Federal</i> crime — both because <i>there is no such Federal crime</i>, and because he could perfectly well have been prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced under perfectly applicable <i>State</i> law.<p>Contrariwise, do you seriously believe that he deserves more than twice the sentence that the people who actually trafficked the drugs got?

"You would not be taxed for generated energy. Imagine that the cost for you to buy one kWh is ~20 cents. Currently, when you push power back into the grid you get 20 cents back from the power company. The government makes this so. However, the power company actually only really needs to bill you about 4-6 cents (depending on which one you ask). The rest is taxation. This means that after the government stops subsidising panels, you would just get 4-6 cents back per kWh.<p>Of course this makes the value proposition for moving power into the grid much worse, but it changes precisely nothing for power that you use from your panels (you are still getting 20 cents worth of power from a panel that has already been paid for by you).<p>For this reason it is best to rely on the subsidy as little as possible and maximise the power you use directly from the panel, either by changing your habits or by storing the power for later (in a battery). Sadly using batteries adds additional costs to this picture and is not currently worth it at all, even without subsidies.",krageon,2019-08-13 12:56:17+00:00,comment

"One of the challenges I face is on temperature. The HVAC unit on our building was not really designed to do even temperature control of an open 60 x 100' space. So we get warm and cold spots, and adjusting one can screw up the others.

"During a lunar eclipse, the surface temperature on the moon drops by about 150 to 250 degrees Celsius in a few minutes. The whole &quot;day&quot; side of the moon—an immense region about seven million square miles in area—is plunged into darkness. For anyone on (that half of) the moon “outdoors”, it would be impossible to miss: one would not even have to look at the sky to see the sun being blotted out by the earth; one could tell from the surrounding light and the temperature. The moon is physically affected in a significant way. Even if someone on the moon did not care about the earth, they would care about the time of the lunar eclipse. All this lines up somewhat (at least matches the timeline) with our apparent perception from earth.<p>During a solar eclipse, someone on the sun would hardly notice. The surface temperature does not change; the brightness does not change; the earth is about a 100 million miles away and occupies less than 10^-7% of the sun&#x27;s sky (18 arc seconds; compare with the ~30 arc minutes that the sun or moon occupy in earth&#x27;s sky). An observer on the sun would need to have very good optical instruments to take note of the entire earth in the first place; let alone the patch of earth a few miles across that is experiencing a total solar eclipse. Unless they were looking for it, they would not be aware of (what the earthlings call) a solar eclipse taking place.<p>(During a solar eclipse, we people on the <i>earth</i> do notice. The sun is hugely significant to the earth physically even though the earth is barely significant to the sun; the temperature can fall by maybe 15 degrees Celsius; people in the affected area of earth are plunged into darkness, etc.)<p>As a physically significant phenomenon, what&#x27;s real during a solar eclipse (in somewhat the same way as a lunar eclipse) is happening on <i>earth</i>; if we called it a terrestrial eclipse it would be fairly real, but is the <i>sun</i> significantly affected? I&#x27;d say not really.<p>---<p>Now, as this is my last post, there are a few philosophical issues this conversation has brought up:<p>- One is a question of ontology: What is &quot;real&quot;? I think people can differ in the level of how physical&#x2F;material their ontology is; certainly everyone would agree about a visual spectacle taking place, but some would consider more &quot;physical&quot; phenomena more real (as in my earlier remark about whether shadows are “real”), and a brightness-and-temperature difference over half the entire moon is surely a physically more significant event (to the moon) than some faraway object casting a shadow on another faraway object would be to the sun.<p>- The second is a question of semantics: What connotations does the word &quot;eclipse&quot; carry? To some people, it carries connotations (e.g. &quot;X-adj eclipse&quot;=&quot;X experiencing a seizure&quot;) such that, for instance, a &quot;solar eclipse&quot;=&quot;sun being darkened&quot; is only appearance not reality, while &quot;lunar eclipse&quot;=&quot;moon being darkened&quot; is both appearance and reality.<p>- The third is a question of interpretation&#x2F;hermeneutics. When I read something, I&#x27;m trying to see: &quot;Is there some interpretation under which what I&#x27;m reading is correct?&quot; The question of &quot;Is there some interpretation under which the author of the above email is wrong, and solar eclipses are similar to lunar eclipses?&quot; is not very interesting; of course the answer is yes, and in my earlier comments I&#x27;ve mentioned at least three interpretations under which the author is wrong. Certainly, it&#x27;s not the language I&#x27;d use: before reading the post I&#x27;d never have described lunar eclipses as real and solar eclipses as virtual, and I probably still won&#x27;t. Maintaining that the author is wrong does not challenge my perspective or contribute anything new to my life. I feel secure in my understanding of eclipses, and if someone has a different perspective, it does not feel like my perspective is being questioned; it&#x27;s just an opportunity. On the other hand, &quot;Is there an interpretation under which the author is right?&quot; (the principle of charity) is more interesting, and having newly experienced this perspective I&#x27;ve been defending an answer of &quot;yes&quot;: yes, not only is there a combination of connotations of &quot;solar eclipse&quot; and &quot;real&quot; under which a so-called solar eclipse is not a &quot;solar-ly&quot; significant event (thus not &quot;real&quot; in that sense), but also it&#x27;s quite a fresh way of looking at things and appreciating how, even though both appear the same to us, one (which we call a &quot;sun-seizure&quot;) is an event of significance only to us puny humans on earth and the sun is unaffected, while the other is truly, improbably, a case where the earth (our home!) has an unmissable effect on the moon, a case where our visual perception, of the moon falling into shadow, is actually correct, something contrary to our perception being so frequently wrong in the astronomical domain where for instance the sun and moon and stars appear to rotate around us every day and night but reality is different.",svat,2019-07-16 20:46:08+00:00,comment

This is a surprisingly difficult problem and yet not as common an issue as you might anticipate. For most use cases you can rely on the filename or extension.<p>I wrote scc and it eventually reached enough people I needed to add some basic checks to determine the difference between coq and verilog. It’s primitive mostly because I try to prioritise speed without losing accuracy. Another code counter tokei does not do this at all and only uses extensions. The number of people unhappy with this decision is surprisingly small.<p>But you could easily get away with just remapping as I doubt they occur in the same repo very often.<p>That said I’m looking at improving this sort of thing because of the number of C with C++ code bases.<p>Oh I should also mention there is no universal list of extension and name to language mapping anywhere online.

Even with miniscule DO (dissolved oxygen) levels - breweries measure in PPB - you have a few weeks until staling can be reliably discriminated.  Distribution takes a couple of those good weeks right off the top in many cases, making stale beer a real issue for people that like hoppy styles.<p>Much of the trendiness is beer now is due to limited distribution.  You can&#x27;t get Pliny on the East Coast, and you can&#x27;t get Alchemist or Treehouse on the West.  You have to have them specially shipped, leading to one of the worst dick-measuring contests in history with the bottle-trade scene.  Those breweries forgo huge sales because they insist on controlling distribution such that quality won&#x27;t suffer.<p>It is absolutely a real issue.<p>Also, any homebrewer can tell you this first hand.  Not just for hops, but delicate malt flavors are often at their peak about two weeks from brewing, just enough time to fully ferment and then mature cold in a keg for a few days.

"<i>UK Treasury and economists from all around the world have all come to the conclusion that a hard brexit is significantly more harmful than a soft brexit</i><p>The problem is that these same people all came to the conclusion that on voting Leave, during the negotiation period the UK would lose 500,000 - 800,000 jobs and enter a massive recession caused by &quot;uncertainty&quot;.<p>The UK has since hit the lowest levels of unemployment on record and economic growth is outstripping Germany, France and Italy.<p>Economists have no credibility with regards to Brexit. None. They have less than zero credibility in fact: if they&#x27;re saying something, it&#x27;s a good sign the reality is the opposite.<p>Thus the idea that no deal would be bad for the UK is a deeply suspect one. There are many things the UK can do outside the EU that would accelerate growth even further still, according to conventional economics.

"Canary - New York City - Full Time, Permanent - Mobile Engineers (and everything else)<p>Hi, we’re Canary… a New York City based startup that is transforming the way people connect to physical places, their family, and their community. We’re building the most consumer friendly “Internet of Things” device that has already won awards and is the most successful crowdfunded consumer product on Indiegogo. We are building a platform that will scale to process more real time video, audio and sensor data than any consumer product on the market.  This is a massive real-time data problem that will change the way people connect to physical places.<p>I lead the mobile team here at Canary and we are looking for Mobile Engineers (1 Android and 1 iOS) to join the team and help us build out our product. Every day we face interesting challenges like:
- Making security and stability our first priority in every decision we make
- Streaming full quality HD video from our Canary device to a mobile client while keeping the latency as close to real time as possible
- Scaling from zero to tens of thousands of paying customers in a matter of months<p>Check out the full details&#x2F;apply here:

"Agreed. AMD <i>desperately</i> needs to adopt cutting edge processes, even if it costs them 50 percent more per chip than it would if it would wait a year or longer.<p>It&#x27;s bad enough that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to outcompete Intel in CPU design anymore, but it&#x27;s making the problem worse by not adopting a modern process, too (as modern as it can be, since Intel is already ahead of other foundries - although the gap will shrink a lot with the next-gen FinFET processes). That especially made it <i>impossible</i> for AMD to enter mobile or even ultrabooks, with AMD&#x27;s old processes and higher power consumption.<p>Fortunately, 1) GF is apparently licensing Samsung&#x27;s 14nm FinFET process, and 2) there&#x27;s a tiny rumor that AMD will be using it by the end of next year, which could be very early in the process&#x27; life.<p>AMD is preparing to announce new CPU micro-architectures for both x86 and ARMv8 in a couple of years.

So why wouldn’t all the small banks just sell their firms to the big ones?<p>“Too small to exist” is the reality, not simply “too big to fail” (aka too well connected to fail). Now we only have 5 mega banks further entrenched. Aircraft manufacturer market is even more limited (the incident with Canada’s Bombardier vs US Boeing showed everything you need to know about that ‘private’ market).<p>I’m not sure what fantasy world people live in when they talk about deregulation of these markets as a common phenomenon, especially airlines, finance, health care, telephony etc (all of the worst industries for consumers in the US, which I should note has nothing to do with the value of public gov run markets which these are not). Absolutely none of those have less administrative oversight than a few decades ago. I guess they listen to politicians instead of any indicators from the market place or history.<p>If the ‘deregulations’ all further entrench the massive companies, while leaving all of the barriers to entry for the small firms.

Pen names for younger authors is a great idea.  Especially for first time authors who don&#x27;t like the limelight and don&#x27;t want to deal with the direct messages they will inevitably receive. And if you have a first time author coach them on the kinds of responses they can expect.  Some negative reviews will get through unless you go to anonymous so education has to be part of that.<p>3) Join in the fight against online harassment.  I don&#x27;t have any links but this is a problem and people need to know that bullying (online) isn&#x27;t OK.<p>4) Edit your posts.  Grammar is much harder to make fun of if the mistakes aren&#x27;t there.  This is not a justification of others actions but a suggestion on how to avoid this specific type of bullying.<p>5) Be active in the HN comments and point out that specific comments aren&#x27;t addressing content but instead just being nit picky.  This could fall into the gratuitous negativity section of the HN guidelines but that&#x27;s kind of a stretch.<p>EDIT: The following are options but things you should not do.  I tried to make that clear with the comments associated with these two options but I didn&#x27;t make it clear enough.  Don&#x27;t do the following two unless you want to completely change your community.<p>6) This is optional but you can implement a login feature that requires people to link to facebook and then you can monitor your readers activity.  It will loose you a ton of traffic but if it&#x27;s really that important to you this is a way you can limit who can read your articles and thereby protect your authors.  I don&#x27;t think this is a good idea personally but it is an idea, only you can decide to lock down your content like that.<p>7) Public shaming, which IMO should be avoided at all costs, but if someone is harassing someone else this can turn the tables.  It also leads to witch hunting and perpetuates a whole different problem that should be avoided at all costs.<p>Online communities have jerks.  No matter where you go you&#x27;ll find them.  HN is no exception.  This community does not ban people from reading articles or monitor it&#x27;s users outside of this site, so HN as an organization can&#x27;t enforce this other than to spread the message and show people it&#x27;s not OK.<p>My suggestion is try 1-5 for now and see how it goes.",bargl,2016-09-30 17:49:09+00:00,comment

"Copied from an HN user who said much better than I could: [1] [EDIT: I&#x27;m now questioning, is it appropriate to repost their words without their knowledge or consent?]<p><i>Human labor is not a commodity.<p>This was the common sense amongst all working people for most of the 20th century. Samuel Gompers, maybe the most conservative labor leader of his time, said &quot;You cannot weigh the human soul on the same scales as piece of pork.&quot; And working people, along with the management class for the most part, understood this to be an undeniable truth. In fact, this piece of common sense was enshrined into US law with the Clayton Act of 1914, which stated &quot;The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.&quot; But in the last 20 years, as capital has gained the firm upper hand, the common sense understanding has shifted towards the idea that labor is in fact a commodity.<p>The ideas behind the so-called &quot;on-demand workforce&quot; further solidify the notion that labor is a commodity. After all, you can order an uber ride just as easily as you can order vitamins online.<p>It&#x27;s so pervasive that even I, someone born into a union family and a firm believer in the idea of worker solidarity, have to force myself to believe that labor is not a commodity. Why? The business class treated labor as expendable in 1915, just as they do in 2015. Why did working people understand this truth in 1915 but not today? I don&#x27;t know.<p>I read a recently released sociology book earlier this year (going crazy looking for the title&#x2F;author, can&#x27;t find it), that posits millennials are far more likely than any recent generation to blame themselves for the problems they face. It&#x27;s part of the reason that the self-help industry is bigger business than it&#x27;s ever been. It&#x27;s not always your fault. Our modern economy is built on rotten ideas like labor = commodity.

"For me, the money quotes was probably the <i>least</i> interesting (other than the take-away that a ~100k salary is probably a fair target for software engineering). The idea of someone only having a rough idea of what software-engineering is (1 year of self-study, more or less) can get an interview at Google at all was far more interesting. Also the fact that pretty much all the companies were absolutely hopeless at evaluating candidates - they might as well ignore resumes and only go direct references, for all their &quot;great hiring process&quot; (this includes Google, apparently).<p>&gt; From no experience to teaching web dev at a bootcamp after three months? one year later offered roles by Google and Airbnb for $250k a year? Is this truly possible?<p>I think the real take-away is that if you can pry open the door, intelligence will always make you an attractive candidate. Especially if you also have the drive to complete projects. Note that this guy went pro poker player at 16, and was in the top tier at 18 -- essentially self-taught.<p>It does seem that the interview process for pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley is hopelessly broken, though. I wish he included some concrete examples about the kind of questions he got, especially the ones he thought were hard. With the little detail in the post, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s &quot;implement a linked list, and show some examples of how one could sort it.&quot; or if it&#x27;s something less trivial. And not to mention how&#x2F;why the problems&#x2F;questions were asked: was it to see <i>if</i> the candidate could solve the problem, or to see <i>how</i> the candidate approached the problem -- with less emphasis on the outcome?<p>I think it sounds ridiculous to &quot;prep&quot; for a job interview. It kind of implies that the interview is broken -- after all you could learn something significant about a position in a week of prep-time, almost anyone should be able to fill that position...<p>Some previous discussion here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11552780"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11552780</a>",e12e,2016-04-24 05:44:49+00:00,comment

You can argue that then people will still spend 2 hours not working, but I think that's not most people's experience.<p>8 hours doesn't make sense for knowledge workers.<p>Even if you're in a position like manufacturing or retail, the continued year over year productivity growth since the 8 hour workday became norm should mean that you can enjoy a higher standard of living while working 25% less time. Of course this is not true as workers' compensation has nothing to do with the surplus value extracted from their labor (a fact which works against you if you actually have to be accountable for your work; OTOH if you spend most of the work day goofing off on the Internet or being an incompetent manager, it really works in your favor).",sedachv,2010-11-19 20:19:18+00:00,comment

"You do realize, on iOS, that most contact info on the device is synced with either Google, or (in iOS 5) iCloud? Facebook is not making this information public, neither are those services.<p>And how can they ask every person in your contacts if they approve: even incorrectly assuming all of them have an account on Facebook, you would still need to upload that information for those accounts to be linked and the request messages to be sent. And that's invading the privacy of the user's address book: they are now sharing that someone is in their address book, even if they didn't want that person to know.<p>Finally, it does say exactly what is uploaded (which is much better, even, than iCloud or Google's sync: seriously, how can you argue that Facebook's contact sync is so awful and ignore Apple and Google's services?): emails, phone numbers, and names (I may be forgetting some here).",Xuzz,2011-10-11 01:48:55+00:00,comment

"I mean, you can come up with a silly example like `sum`, but here&#x27;s a more real-world example (takes the width and height of a container, and calculates a scaling factor and translation which make an element fit inside the container at a target aspect ratio).<p><pre><code>    const containerRatio = (containerWidth &#x2F; containerHeight);
    const targetRatio = (targetWidth &#x2F; targetHeight);
    const useVertical = (containerRatio &gt; targetRatio);

    const scaleFactor = (isVertical
      ? (containerHeight &#x2F; targetHeight)
      : (containerWidth &#x2F; targetWidth)
    );

    const scaledWidth   = targetWidth * scaleFactor;
    const scaledHeight  = targetHeight * scaleFactor;

    let x0 = 0;
    if (isVertical) {
      x0 = 0.5 * (containerWidth - scaledWidth);
      x0 &#x2F;= (1 - scaleFactor);
    }

    let y0 = 0;
    if (!isVertical) {
      y0 = 0.5 * (containerHeight - scaledHeight);
      y0 &#x2F;= (1 - scaleFactor);
    }

    return [[x0, y0], scalingFactor];
</code></pre>
You could also write this as:<p><pre><code>    const r  = (w &#x2F; h);
    const tr  = (tw &#x2F; th);
    const m   = (r &gt; tr ? (h &#x2F; th) : (w &#x2F; tw));
    const o = [0, 0];
    if (r &gt; tr) {
      o[0] = (0.5 * (w - tw * m)) &#x2F; (1 - m);
    } else {
      o[1] = (0.5 * (h - th * m)) &#x2F; (1 - m);
    }
    return [o, m];
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s certainly terser (and I could have made it terser still), but the first example scans better IMO, because it breaks the expression evaluation down into steps which explain what the calculation is doing.<p>If there was a problem with the second example, I&#x27;d have to more or less rewrite the logic myself into the first form in order to figure out what it was doing.",mhink,2021-10-20 19:43:07+00:00,comment

"You have to dig deeper. In general, impact of soviet period is way overstated by foreigners (I&#x27;m Russian myself). The trend you&#x27;re describing might be true, but some researchers draw its origins as far as Mongolian reign over Russia (roughly XIII-XV century).<p>If anything, Russian population always shows preference for a strong leadership (which is often appropriate to rephrase as &quot;borderline or outright dictatorship&quot;). Ivan the Terrible was saved from a coup by public support, several times. There&#x27;s a much joked-about statement &quot;Сталина на вас нет!&quot; (&quot;Shame there&#x27;s no Stalin to set you straight!&quot;), attributed to crazy old people.<p>In general, every time there was a violently harsh leader, some people will remember him (or her, in two cases) as incredibly effective. This goes at least a thousand years back, and probably as far as Rurik (legendary Scandinavian ruler INVITED by Russians of the time because &quot;our land is big and rich, but there&#x27;s no order in it&quot;).<p>We&#x27;re also always scoring sky-high on &quot;Uncertainty Avoidance&quot; in Hofstede&#x27;s cultural scale (google it, it&#x27;s cool), and believe me, it shows in countless ways in day-to-day lives.

"It&#x27;s important to note that price, the last traded price, and value are all distinct concepts. The last traded price is the only one of these we can measure ahead of time, so we often use it as a metanym for these other concepts. But we don&#x27;t know the price of something until we make a binding offer on it and it is accepted; that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the next transaction won&#x27;t be very different, we just have heuristics about how the next price ought to look. But it&#x27;s the process of negotiating a deal or bidding on an auction that defines the price, not the historical prices. If you go to a grocery store and see that milk costs $5.25, and you remember last week it costs $5.00, you don&#x27;t say the price is wrong; you understand that this is the offer the store has made you, and that the price has gone up since your last visit.<p>When the oil futures went negative, it wasn&#x27;t the case that the value of oil was negative - this was about the structure of the market and the sorts of positions people were caught in when the pandemic hit. We continued to consume oil throughout the pandemic, and so I&#x27;d say we continued to value it.<p>Another example would be, if a rancher has a lot of cow poop, they might pay a farmer to take it away. You could say that the cow poop has a negative price on it. But the farmer is going to make use of it as fertilizer; from the farmer&#x27;s perspective, this is a commodity that has value.<p>It&#x27;s true though that there are a million theories of value and it&#x27;s impossible to say what something&#x27;s value is definitively, you can only make a decision about what is value is to you.<p>But when wash trading is and to impact the perceived value, it does so fraudulently; it supplies information to traders - &quot;there is a lot of interest in this security, and the (last traded) price is rising&quot; - which is a lie. Some people will argue this too is a normal and healthy part of markets, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve given enough thought to what sort of equilibrium that game will settle into.",maxbond,2022-09-15 20:05:33+00:00,comment

"One of the difficulties about being a creative is that bullshit is often required to earn enough to live off of.

If DDG uses the Bing API and is passing the search term to whatever search-related text ads they show, that's a pretty big blind spot for the privacy advocates.  Because Bing still gets your search term and so does the ad network.  What they don't get is your IP address, but as the AOL search dump proved, sometimes search terms alone are enough to identify someone.

"1. It&#x27;s assumed that the seed you get from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom is unguessable. This is a very solid assumption to make. The reason why it&#x27;s a good idea to use an HMAC is entirely different and is the following classes of attacks, not a matter of costs of bruteforcing (which is impossible becase of the search space, without having some clue of the content or state of &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom). For example, for an error the code could be written to SHA1(seed || counter). In this case you can &quot;re-open&quot; the hash function and perform an &quot;length extension attack&quot;, so you add &quot;0&quot; at the end and successfully predicted one of the successive IDs. HMACs are constructs used to make sure the secret and plaintex is mixed in a more cryptographic robust way, basically.<p>2) If you don&#x27;t trust &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom to seed the generator, you have no reasons to trust that &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom cannot be predicted by observing some part of the old stream of bytes.<p>More information about the attack I described are available here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Length_extension_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Length_extension_attack</a>",antirez,2015-11-22 07:27:50+00:00,comment

"<i>More than that: we don’t see any need to search for a device that is different from, or not integral to, the legitimate communication. [earlier cases] added this “different device” requirement to the statutory text to avoid what those judges thought would otherwise be a rule that made ordinary usage of a telephone or computer criminal. These judges feared that, unless the “device” must be extraneous to a proper communication, a person answering his own phone at home, and holding a conversation with a friend, would violate the Wiretap Act by acquiring the content of his own conversation using his own phone (a “device”).<p>This fear just shows why </i>it is a mistake to read snippets of a statute in isolation. <i>For another section of the Wiretap Act declares that “it shall not be unlawful ... for a person ... to intercept a wire, oral or electronic communication where such person is a party to the ommunication or where one of the parties ... has given prior consent.” [] So acquiring the contents of one’s own conversation, and sharing them over a speakerphone, is not unlawful, no matter what the word “device” means. It is better to follow the statute than to make up limitations to avert imaginary problems.</i><p>It would save a great deal of time and effort if this point made by Judge Easterbrook were more widely appreciated.<p>So many people think the law is like a series of logical assertions, and that if they can just find one error or inconsistency therein then the whole is invalidated, somewhat like a mathematical theorem or a piece of procedural computer code.

I have been setting up something recently using k3s (more specifically k3d for k3s in Docker) and it seems great so far. I&#x27;m having to use k3d since I&#x27;m not in Linux but as soon as WSL2 is available then I can even get rid of the Docker part I think.<p>I like the idea of having a developer be able to play entirely with their own local infrastructure to get as close to production as possible.<p>A hosted service will definitely make this less painful but once you get up to speed with k3s then I doubt there is anything faster than using it.,carlreid,2020-05-22 14:48:02+00:00,comment

"Oh for sure, I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that Jobs was _only_ on the spectrum.<p>I work in film (in addition to tech) and know a lot of people on the spectrum that I think people who only meet autistic programmers would have difficulty recognizing.<p>Even in TFA, one of the descriptors is:<p>&gt; <i>They generally marry the first girl they date</i><p>Maybe, but in my experience, that&#x27;s only one specific kind of person with Aspergers (who I agree definitely exists).

The migration affects how processes are accessed (IP addresses and ports), and changes are required on our end.<p>This developer does not know anything about kubernetes and does not know anything about the changes in the other system.  He does not understand why any access methods may have changed, and he is irritated that an external system is pushing a new requirement onto his task list when it worked perfectly fine before.

"A few years ago, Nintendo made a wonderful game called Super Mario Run. It was simple - Mario automatically runs and you tap to jump - but surprisingly deep. The timing of the jumps and the height of jump was paramount, and there was a ton of replayability in trying to get out-of-reach coins and finding shortcuts. It also captured the aesthetic of the Mario World games with modern graphics. I was VERY skeptical of a mobile Mario game, but was won over by the quality of game design and the clear level of polish.<p>Nintendo charged $9.99 for this game. The response was absolute evisceration in the ratings. Mobile game players EXPECTED a F2P experience that would waste their time with energy charge ups, loot boxes, etc. and were upset when Nintendo didn&#x27;t do that.
In response, Nintendo switched to this type of experience for their next release, Fire Emblem, which performed much better.<p>The Wikipedia article for Super Mario Run explains in detail.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Mario_Run#Commercial"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Mario_Run#Commercial</a><p>A select quote - &#x27;[Nintendo President] Kimishima said that &quot;we honestly prefer the Super Mario Run model&quot;, though in a June 2017 investor question-and-answer session, he said &quot;in the future we will consider not only a single set price, but other methods that incorporate a wider variety of elements that allow as many consumers as possible to play&quot;&#x27;",yourdeadneopet,2022-03-28 07:34:36+00:00,comment

"<p><pre><code>  The belief that interests arrive fully formed and must simply be “found” can lead people to limit their pursuit of new fields and give up when they encounter challenges, according to a new Stanford study.

  Mantras like “find your passion” carry hidden implications, the researchers say. They imply that once an interest resonates, pursuing it will be easy. But, the research found that when people encounter inevitable challenges, that mindset makes it more likely people will surrender their newfound interest.

"Actual animal-meat burgers don&#x27;t literally have blood in them. They have myoglobin, which is similar to the hemoglobin found in blood, but different. So a burger doesn&#x27;t bleed, it has moisture which makes it wet and myoglobin which makes it red, but the red liquid isn&#x27;t blood.<p>Anyway, there are 3 purposes I can think of:<p>(1) Looks. The myoglobin substitute, leghemoglobin, that they put in the Impossible Burger will make it look more like real meat, which will visually appeal to people who like meat.<p>(2) Flavor. Myoglobin also affects flavor, so again a more realistic imitation of meat. (Incidentally, apparently myoglobin content is the main difference between dark and light meat chicken. Myoglobin stores oxygen, so muscles that get used more need to contain more of it. Since chickens walk way more than they fly, chicken breasts have little myglobin whereas chicken legs and thighs have more.)<p>(3) Nutrition. Myoglobin contains iron. People always talk about vegetarians getting enough protein, but iron might actually be a bigger challenge. And heme iron (as found in meat&#x27;s myoglobin and in Impossible&#x27;s leghemoglobin) is easier to absorb than non-heme iron (as generally found in plants).",adrianmonk,2018-08-18 23:55:26+00:00,comment

"I am new to CNNs&#x2F;machine learning, but here&#x27;s my $0.02:
Regardless of which technique you use, it seems that the amount of data required to learn is too high. This article talks about neural networks accessing billions of photographs, a number which is nowhere near the number of photos&#x2F;objects&#x2F;whatever a human sees in a lifetime. Which leads me to the conclusion that we aren&#x27;t extracting much information from the data. These techniques aren&#x27;t able to calculate how the same object might look under different lighting conditions, different viewing angles, positions, sizes, and so on. Instead, companies just use millions of images to &#x27;encode&#x27; the variations into their networks.<p>Imo there should be a push towards adapting CNNs to calculate&#x2F;predict how the object might look under different conditions, which might lead to other improvements. This could also be extended to areas other than image recognition.",cynicaldevil,2016-07-21 11:58:24+00:00,comment

"I agree with you that there isn&#x27;t any legal discourse on implications. It&#x27;s immaterial in these protests as it is a manifestation of despair due to economic reality and worsening living conditions without a hope of revival.<p>1. Extradition treaty require local competent court to make a decision whether to extradite or not. But For majority of protestors it is immaterial because the perception is that Hong Kong do not have a decent judiciary or legal system, it works at the whims of China (again a perception created by few). So the actual discussion no one wants to discuss or hear.<p>2. YouTube, Facebook and Twitter does not like privacy. Because their basic business is to trade personal information and time for free service. So try using any of them through TOR or VPN they will block you or make it very difficult, independent from which country you belong. In this aspect so far only EU is trying to preserve some privacy but still not enough with many loopholes.<p>3. Again as I mentioned in no 1, here majority of the protestors do not even understand how extradition works.

"It&#x27;s a good set of suggestions, but it doesn&#x27;t touch on the key problem with &quot;mobile&quot; interfaces - <i>notifications.</i>  The core evil (dark design?) of most mobile interfaces to various networks, social or not, is that they can use notifications to get the user into their app.  While there&#x27;s some ability to restrict notifications, there&#x27;s still not huge support (at least that I know of... maybe it exists and I&#x27;ve missed it?) for levels of notification by default.  You can go and turn some options off in an app, if it supports it, but in general, there are tiers of notifications.<p>High priority is &quot;The world is on fire.&quot;  Be it your pager for work, or, more often in my case, &quot;The hill I live on is on fire, <i>again</i>...&quot;, these are the things a mobile device is useful for.  I&#x27;d argue that phone calls serve this purpose currently, because the cell network has made calls suck for everything else with latency...<p>Most of the person to person communications (outside group chats) tends to fall into the &quot;Important, but not immediate&quot; category.  This is what I tend to use my phone for, so my notifications are around this.<p>Then there&#x27;s the clutter of other notifications ranging from &quot;Oh, hey, you got more spam email!&quot; to &quot;Please come check into our app again, we miss your eyeballs on our ads!&quot;  These are fairly unimportant and probably shouldn&#x27;t exist, in most cases.  But most of them are low priority.<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to set things up so that notifications are batched over some period of time, instead of being immediate (unless it&#x27;s high priority - if my wife is sending me a picture of A or B at the store, I need to respond to that quickly enough).  But for other stuff, I&#x27;d love to see batched notifications on an hourly, or perhaps even daily basis.<p>I simulate this on my devices by largely running &quot;pull&quot; instead of &quot;push&quot; for almost everything - outside direction communication from people, which is what I use my phone for, I have notifications turned off.  I check my email often enough mostly that I don&#x27;t need notifications for my primary account (it&#x27;s not for anything time sensitive so if I check once or twice a day this is fine), though it does lead to some priority inversions in that infrequently used accounts actually do send prompt notifications.  I don&#x27;t have a way to queue these for once a day or something and still get notifications, and I tend to fail to check them otherwise.<p>If you allow your devices to go back to &quot;pull mode&quot; instead of &quot;push mode,&quot; you remove a lot of the evils of most of the applications in terms of attention vampire effects.<p>But a more flexible notification system would be really, really useful.",Syonyk,2021-07-04 19:10:05+00:00,comment

"Static Site Generators basically compile the entire site and serve it as static files to a S3 equivalent bucket with the API component which could connect anywhere. There are faster compilers than others (i.e. Hugo, written with Go) that can compile 1000s of pages in a handful of seconds while others are slower comparatively (i.e. Jekyll); I personally like Gatsby[1] since it&#x27;s Javascript based making it easy for me to understand and debug. There are setups where those builds can be more modular, so in the case of your News Industry example, you can split it up by section or have custom builds with web hooks based on the section that needs to be updated.<p>Comments normally would probably be something like Disqus but I&#x27;ve also seen a demo of a Netlify dev doing a hacky hijack of their forms function which allowed you to approve a comment then re-render based on approved comments.<p>You can also setup a CD system that builds every X seconds&#x2F;minutes&#x2F;hours&#x2F;days&#x2F;etc.<p>It&#x27;s just a different way to build websites.

"I was pro-nuclear because I believe these systems are technically safe and sound, we need nuclear to reduce the dependence of fossil fuels, we need nuclear to balance the unstable power output from solar and wind, also that the Generation III+ reactors are promising, we need to widely deploy them and continue to advance the technology.<p>Today, I still believe the technology, but I doubt about its practicality, both financially and politically.<p>1. If we do a cost-benefit analysis, we must realize that the political resistance of the nuclear power plant <i>is</i> parts of its cost, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the anti-nuclear politicians or activists are correct or not, in either way, it simply adds to the cost of the project. Sometimes the cost is serious - the complete halt of the project is not out of the possibilities, and it means <i>billions</i> of tax dollars are wasted on useless projects.<p>2. Also, the strong pressure and paranoia on its safety, both from the public, and from the engineers, is sometimes responsible for the escalating costs of the projects, as more and more safety upgrades are implemented over time. I&#x27;m not saying that safety is not important, but it means there are hidden costs. And because safety is paramount, you can&#x27;t just ignore them,<p>e.g. a safety risk is discovered in incident X, to avoid similar problems, all the XYZ reactors must be upgraded!<p>e.g. the nuclear reactor Y has an minor anomaly Z, it&#x27;s believed that the issue is not a big deal, but for safety, the reactors are switched off until the reason is determined! <i>(6 months later)</i> Engineers have determined the issue is a completely normal phenomenon within the design! <i>(3 months later)</i> The executive&#x2F;legislative body finally allowed the reactors to be restarted...<p>Just think about how much economic damage is done in this process... Worse, any such problems, even it was the direct result of being safety-minded, will be attacked by the anti-nuclear activists and politicians, further contributing to problem No.1, make the cost even greater.<p>3. In addition, a nuclear power plant requires highly competent personnels, companies and regulatory agencies to run and monitor. Mismanagement due to incompetency can make its safety risks much higher than the projected risks. It&#x27;s not a big problem if it&#x27;s operated with a good record of safety in some countries with a government that has a relatively good public image, but in other countries it&#x27;s a big problem. I&#x27;ve once asked a networking engineer from Taiwan about the nuclear protests over the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant, he said he was against the project, not because he doesn&#x27;t believe the technology (which is the most common reason in the anti-nuclear movement), but that he has no confidence that the miserable government is competent enough to operate it.<p>4. Furthermore, the political resistance of deep underground nuclear waste disposal repository is even higher. One should realize that currently there are already thousands buckets of nuclear waste waiting for proper disposal, and without a deep underground repository, by doing nothing, the risks for the environment is much more higher. Unfortunately, as long as the political resistance exists, it adds a huge cost to everything nuclear. Not to mention the environmental risks of continue producing more nuclear waste without a repository.<p>5. Finally, even in China - one of the biggest supporters of nuclear power - the ambitious construction projects are slowing down due to reason No.1 and No.2, despite that the political resistance is not a big problem in its authoritarian political system. Competition of cheap solar and wind is another reason.<p>&gt; China’s losing its taste for nuclear power. That’s bad news.<p>&gt; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;612564&#x2F;chinas-losing-its-taste-for-nuclear-power-thats-bad-news&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;612564&#x2F;chinas-losing-its-...</a><p>I&#x27;m really uncertain about everything now.

"Best part...<p>&gt;While waiting for the May 1 reset might look tempting to launch directly into the 9.62% rate, I still strongly recommend buying I Bonds before April 30, which will lock in a 7.12% rate for a full six months, followed by 9.62% for six months. That’s an annual rate of about 8.4%, and there is no other very safe investment that can match that return.<p>&gt;I Bonds must be held for 12 months before you can redeem them. If you redeem them before five years, you will forfeit the last three months of interest. But if you buy near the end of April 2022, you will get full credit for April and can redeem 14 months and a few days later, avoiding taking the interest penalty on the 9.62% rate.<p>&gt;However, I always recommend buying I Bonds every year up to the purchase cap of $10,000 per person per year and holding them until you actually need the money. People who have been buying I Bonds for years — like many of my readers — are very happy right now, collecting an annual rate of 8.4%, plus any fixed rate attached to the original purchase.",hnburnsy,2022-04-12 18:25:31+00:00,comment

  creation of British technical writer
  Ray Girvan, who introduced him in an April Fool&#x27;s hoax

  Additional details of the hoax include the rediscovery of
  Udo&#x27;s works by the also-fictional Bob Schipke, a Harvard
  mathematician, who supposedly saw a picture of the
  Mandelbrot set in an illumination for a 13th-century carol.
  Girvan also attributed Udo as a mystic and poet whose

"It staggers me that so much prevailing thought still leans towards the idea of complex, highly connected systems as inherently stable, with their natural state as equilibrium. It dates back to the victorians, with their ""All things Bright and Beautiful"" view of god's creation, which was shattered by darwin. How long it takes us to learn the important lessons.<p>This view was prevalent in the world of ecology for decades, and led to all that guff about ""nature's balance"" and ""spaceship earth"" that we had to put up with for so long. It turned out that these ideas were based on falsified studies.<p>Adam Curtis addressed these ideas and more in his recent series of films, All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace. Specifically, the second episode: ""The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts.""

"<i>So, the bit shift question: that come up down one branch of a system design question that we used for a while (we&#x27;ve since moved to a more targeted version that is more repeatable). The (sub)issue involved adding a binary flag to a large data blob (this came up as part of a solution to a real-world caching problem). Adding a single bit flag to the front of a 1GB blob has a problem. To really add just one bit, you&#x27;d have to bitshift the entire 1GB. This is clearly not worth it to save 7 bits of storage (ignoring that that would not be saved in any case). You can just use a byte (or word), or add the flag at the end. When candidates suggested adding a bit flag at the front, we would follow up asking them how they&#x27;d do it (to unearth if they were using &#x27;bit&#x27; as a shorthand for a reasonable solution, or if they really are a little weak in binary data manipulation). This was one small part of our interview. By itself it in no way determined the outcome of the interview, or even of the low-level systems section. Plenty of great engineers might get it wrong. But I don&#x27;t think it was unfair.</i><p>Of course it&#x27;s unfair. The candidate isn&#x27;t actually programming a solution when they&#x27;re talking to you. They&#x27;re on a tight time crunch, under a microscope, in front of an interviewer. The answers to your questions will literally make or break their future with you. Did you specify to them in your original question that the entries in the cache are 1GB large? If you assigned them the task of implementing a solution to your caching question, they would immediately notice using a 1-bit flag is a poor design decision.<p>The point is:<p><i>Plenty of great engineers might get it wrong.</i><p>That says quite a lot more about Triplebyte&#x27;s question than the engineers. A wrong answer doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re weak in bit manipulation or that they decide to implement poor solutions. It says they&#x27;re suffering from interview jitters. They&#x27;re weak in the artificial environment you&#x27;ve constructed for the purposes of the interview, which may or may not correlate with their actual ability.<p>This may sound like useless theorizing, but unfortunately a massive number of excellent engineers are <i>awful</i> in an interview setting. But if you give them a problem to actually solve, they pass with flying colors.<p>Triplebyte does give problems to candidates to solve, but it sounds like you also care about whether they can pass your interview (by demonstrating sufficient max skill when prompted) instead of whether they can implement solutions to the problems you assign to them. This rules out candidates who would otherwise do very well, which is the type of candidate you&#x27;re trying to find.<p>I know that you&#x27;re saying the verbal section of the interview isn&#x27;t the whole process, but are you sure it&#x27;s an effective one?<p>It might be positively misleading. A candidate who is very strong in the area you&#x27;re looking for is also likely to be someone who will get your questions completely wrong, because they&#x27;re not programming. They&#x27;re talking. So it sounds like you&#x27;re selecting for people who can talk well: those who can show strength during your interview when prompted verbally. Is that the right metric to find talented candidates?<p>If you were to put together a pipeline where e.g. you give candidates an XCode codebase and say &quot;There are bugs in this codebase, and &lt;specific missing features&gt;. Implement as many fixes or improvements as you wish or have time for, then send us the code,&quot; you would have a mechanism which selects for candidates who are ~100% competent, since that&#x27;s exactly the type of work they&#x27;ll be doing on a day-to-day basis.<p>Some candidates wouldn&#x27;t want to do that, so perhaps there should be an alternative for them. But it&#x27;d be vastly more effective than quiz-style questions during a timeboxed interview.<p>It&#x27;s possible to come up with endless reasons why it might be a bad idea to set up a pipeline like that. But all the companies that have set it up have been shocked how well it works when they rely <i>solely</i> on that test. Instead of an opportunity to show strength during an interview, the candidate is able to directly answer the question &quot;Can they do the work?&quot;<p>EDIT: From one of the other comments (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13834231"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13834231</a>):<p>&gt; I applied through their project track.

After which I got a rejection saying that my project was great but my interview performance was so poor that they wouldn&#x27;t move forward.<p>It sounds like Triplebyte almost has the pipeline described above, but it won&#x27;t work if you watch the candidate or ask them to do more work.

- Using a different template engine in general (wanted to use thymeleaf)
- Not able to bind forms to objects

"I doubt it. Being the most popular (and open source) kernel means that anyone looking to experiment or improve in this area will almost definitively go to Linux. Combine that with the fact that Linux has major corporate support, and many of those sponsors have an interest in the kernel being good, it is not surprising that Linux is doing well in this area.<p>However, this also means that the kernel is (in some ways) optimized for more server/super computer type stuff which prefers throughput over latency, at the expense of desktop/smartphone use, which prefers low latency over throughput.<p>Of course, in many cases there is an option between approaches (either at compile or run time). In the case of the scheduler however, they decided not to support multiple implementations in the mainline. This leaves us with the highly complicated implementation suitable for high end computer, and not the simpler Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) that shows minor improvements in desktop use.<p>Of course, using BFS is only a patch away, and several desktop distributions do use it.",gizmo686,2013-05-10 23:38:56+00:00,comment

If you have budget of several tens of billions and you want to be judicious where you invest, it is unrealistic to expect to create magic in Africa over 100-200 years. In that situation the best you could hope to achieve for that continent is to invest in medicine aka what Bill Gates is doing, and hope that it will help turn the continent from 3rd world to something like Mexico (which is still far from great).

Who profits?<p>&gt; There is no immediate pressure on us to produce Aristotles et. al. because they are not going to bring immediate benefit<p>First of all, it could be argued that someone like Plato has made a huge contribution to Greek and Roman civilizations. Aristotle was the personal tutor of Alexander the Great for God&#x27;s sake. These individuals contributed tremendously, both within their lifetimes and in the millennia after. Second, even if you discount the influence these people had in the Ancient world, and assume that the majority of it is felt 1000 years after their death, then <i>still</i> it is better to have them sooner rather than later. For that means waiting 1000 years for the next step in our civilization rather than 2000 years.<p>&gt; Darwinism requires diversity.

"&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s honestly quite scary how I&#x27;m in the top 2% of income earners in my generation and yet I could barely afford to buy a small place<p>&gt; I live in Los Angeles, where a &quot;small place in semi-desirable area&quot; gets listed for 1.5M and goes for nearly 2M. I&#x27;m somewhere in the top 5% of earners in California, but that $2M 1950s tract housing would be &gt;50% of my post-tax income.<p>I think the obvious answer here is that people in the top 2% or top 5% are not buying houses... It&#x27;s the people in the top 0.1%. Last time I was home shopping, we were regularly outbid by all-cash offers of 50%-100% over asking price, no contingencies. These competing bidders are not teachers and nurses. They&#x27;re not even high-paid tech employees. Do you really think a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft has $2.5M in cash sitting in his checking account to buy a home? No way. These are all businesses, investors, serial landlords buying their 60th house, hedge funds, 0.1% wealthy people--that&#x27;s who&#x27;s buying all these houses.

"It seems that the business in question is in the travel industry, specifically helping people find airport parking deals. Due to the Covid-19 situation I&#x27;m sure they got hit very hard and a lot of chargebacks or refunds happened as flights got cancelled.<p>Stripe has to make sure that there are enough funds in the account to cover these transaction reversals. So I can understand where they are coming from. Trying to prove that you have enough cash in your bank account is obviously not going to work because that cash could be gone at any time or otherwise already claimed. If you got the cash then what difference does it make to you if it&#x27;s in your bank or in Stripe for a month? I think this point goes against the business. One would hope that as air travel goes back to normal, the rolling reserve gets smaller. A 28 days rolling reserve should not be the end of the world.<p>That being said I think this could have been handled much better by Stripe. This robotic &quot;we care so much about you which is why we are doing $tough_thing to you&quot; that is all too common nowerdays has to stop. It&#x27;s a lie. It does not help the business in any way, it is just there to prevent losses for Stripe. Please drop that BS corp speak. Give the guys a call and explain the situation. Give the guys a heads-up and some time to adjust. Don&#x27;t just drop the hammer like that. Engage in a discussion, try to see what can be done together.

"Or you could just implement this (A submission from Google Brain to ICLR 2017):<p><i>In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.84, which is only 0.1 percent worse and 1.2x faster than the current state-of-the-art model. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art.</i>[1]<p>To translate that, they built and train a RNN to design neural networks. These machine designed networks are almost equal to the best human designed network on an image-recognition benchmark, and outperform the best human-designed systems on a text understanding benchmark.<p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openreview.net&#x2F;forum?id=r1Ue8Hcxg"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openreview.net&#x2F;forum?id=r1Ue8Hcxg</a>",nl,2016-11-06 11:45:34+00:00,comment

"I do something similar. My method is always to try and fit everything I need for an exam on a single A5 sheet of paper, as if I could take it into the exam with me. The first 5 or so drafts I&#x27;d never be able to fit enough on, so with each iteration I make the writing smaller, or work out a pictorial code, or condense my explanation of a method to squeeze on as much as I could. By the time I&#x27;ve finally managed to fit it all on one side of paper, I&#x27;ve thought about how to compact the information in so many different ways that I could recite everything on the paper without it.

"Rust&#x27;s errors are definitely the best of any language I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s one reason it&#x27;s nice to write Rust after a day fighting with SQL Server for example which seems to still think in 2021 that &quot;Syntax error&quot; is a reasonable diagnostic message.<p>As to &quot;How to fix it&quot; however if you have lifetime confusion the error reported by the borrow checker probably isn&#x27;t going to suggest refactoring your code with a design that makes sense even though that&#x27;s likely the correct solution. It would be cute if the Rust compiler said &quot;I think you want a Boxed collection of strings here to use the algorithm you&#x27;re attempting, change how this is represented in all the related structs too, here&#x27;s how:&quot; but that&#x27;s unrealistic and, more importantly, <i>no other language is doing a better job here</i>.<p>While Rust makes the errors themselves look easy, the right suggestion is context sensitive anyway. In my AoC solutions, unwrap() was the correct answer anywhere the problem is &quot;I have an Option or a Result and I wish that I didn&#x27;t&quot;. Because it&#x27;s AoC if I&#x27;m wrong to be so cavalier I will eat a panic immediately, and I don&#x27;t plan to maintain this stuff. In a real project I probably want to explicitly handle None and Error in some places, and pass on Errors in other places, even when I don&#x27;t I should write an expect() in case I&#x27;m maintaining this years from now.<p>More likely in lifetime confusion scenarios the equivalent C++ compiles but just has mysterious crashes or bugs and the equivalent Java has runtime Null reference errors, Concurrency errors, a truly enormous memory leak, data races, other mysterious mutation bugs, or all of the above.

"The way I look at modern Scala is a mix of Python and Java.<p>Do it badly, and you end up with the unmaintainability of Python and the clunkiness of Java. Awful.<p>Do it well, and you end up with the convenience and interactivity of Python and the typesafety, performance, and toolability of Java.<p>This lets you implement your code quickly the first time, and have it run blazing fast on a hot JVM, with the compiler having your back as you grow your codebase in size and complexity. Sure beats trying to prototype in Java, or porting half your Python prototype to C when you realize it’s too slow.<p>Scala has a bad reputation, well-earned due to an early culture of crazy experiments, crazy operators, and crazy tools. But those days are behind us.<p>You can no longer get stuff into the standard library “just because”, and a lot of the early experiments in that category (xml, parallel collections, parser combinators) has been consciously moved out.<p>Operator-heavy tools like SBT have largely replaced the crazy operators, while operator-heavy libraries like Dispatch have been largely replaced by less-operator-heavy equivalents.<p>SBT used to be awful, but it’s improved a lot. And you don’t need to use it: I haven’t touched an SBT build in years by now, in both OSS and proprietary contexts.<p>There remains a lot of different ways to write Scala, more than most languages, but you don’t need to write Haskell-in-Scala unless you really want to.<p>I’m personally very happy with my Python-like language with Python-like libraries, with static typing for maintainability, orders of magnitude better runtime performance, excellent parallelism and concurrency, one of the best compile-to-JS experiences in the world, and the best tooling (IDEs, profilers, monitoring, etc.) on the market.<p>As someone who maintains optimized programming language interpreters, distributed backend clusters, three-tier web apps, command-line tools, and many other things on a daily basis, I appreciate being able to do all this in one language rather than juggling 5 different languages (and 5 different sets of libraries, and 5 different sets of tools, ...) to satisfy each use case.<p>Scala may be diverse and fragmented, but it’s not as diverse or fragmented as the polyglot Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;C&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Javascript codebase it would likely take to replace Scala for my daily work",lihaoyi,2019-12-21 16:02:08+00:00,comment

Also at some point, Rust will also need good libraries for talking to the GPU.<p>- I&#x2F;O concurrency. This is where you have a server that needs to respond quickly to 10,000+ sockets, for example. For this, it looks like everyone is standardizing on futures and tokio: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexcrichton&#x2F;futures-rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexcrichton&#x2F;futures-rs</a> <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;tokio"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;tokio</a><p>But it seems like you&#x27;re most interested in Erlang-style actors with M:N green threads? The issue here is that—as best I remember the history of Rust—the Rust maintainers decided that green threads were simply too high a level of abstraction for Rust. I think Rust will eventually move back in that direction, first using futures+tokio+async I&#x2F;O, and then by eventually adding async&#x2F;await sugar on top. That way, you&#x27;ll only pay for coroutines&#x2F;green threads when you explicitly opt in. But it will take a year or so for all this to start maturing, I think.<p>In the meantime, tokio&#x27;s method-chaining syntax should actually be somewhat tolerable, especially because Rust has a `#[must_use]` attribute that prevents you from forgetting to use a future. If you&#x27;re lazy, just run everything through rustfmt to get the indentation right.",ekidd,2017-01-08 15:09:24+00:00,comment

"It can be worse. A O(n log n) algorithm might be slower than a O(n^2) algorithm for all practical values of n.<p>Also, one should be careful what to count. Sorting strings, for example, is not quite O(n log n); average string length/expected offset of first difference/whatever should also be in that O().<p>Along the same line, for many algorithms, cache-locality is more important than number of CPU cycles. So, counting cache misses rather tha cycles can be the better way to judge an algorithm.",Someone,2011-03-06 08:36:25+00:00,comment

"The reasons why Ecuador took Assange in in the first place no longer make much sense. Under Correa, there were a number of tensions with the US that were looming large in Ecuadorian political landscape following a default in 08. By taking in Assange, Correa could both shore up anti-US sentiments at home that were mounting in criticism over an oil export deal, and get a bargaining chip to boot if he needed it. With Correa out of the picture and China stepping in and propping up exports, this makes little sense, and Assange&#x27;s value as a bargaining chip is dubious to a Trump admin.<p>Back when Wikileaks had a better reputation, it also helped affray Correa&#x27;s attacks on free speech at home.

Whole wheat bread is just whole wheat flour, water and yeast.  You are getting all of the grain.  With sometimes salt added.

"I used intellij to debug 3 processes over ssh, it worked seamlessly.
The problem with logging is that you have to know where to log. Debuggers are excellent for exploration, where logging implies you already put the code. If you forget some log you need to do the whole build&#x2F;deploy dance, with a debugger I just restart. There are even time travel debuggers that allow replays.",mping,2022-05-06 20:11:11+00:00,comment

"&gt; Except that the price of water varies based on the season and you are obligated to sell water at a fixed price when it is convenient for the buyer and buy water back at the same time when it is also convenient for the buyer (duck curve).<p>Everything happens instantaneously. The same moment the buyer returns 5 water bottles, they are purchased by another. The credit that one receives receives is for exactly the amount the other buyer pays, and they cancel out. It is as if the sale was always to the second buyer to begin with.<p>&gt; Over the course of a season the buyer has stated that his intention is to buy as much as he sells and be net-zero every season but refuses to store even a single bottle of water (e.g. batteries). The buyer would be very upset if water always be available at any time of the day or night in reasonable quantities. The buyer doesn&#x27;t want to pay any costs for bottling (peaker plants, hydro), storage (batteries, pumped hydro) or water distribution (grid).<p>There is nothing to bottle, the water is still in the same bottle it was purchased in. There is nothing to store, the water is produced and consumed instantaneously. The distribution is paid for by the second buyer who purchases it.<p>&gt; The buyer has a habit of buying water when there is a drought and it is expensive and sell it back to you when there is a flood and water is cheap. The buyer doesn&#x27;t want to change his lifestyle so that his water usage was more in-line with with the seasons (e.g. smart thermostats, lifestyle changes). The buyer has zero incentive to reduce his overall usage below current levels.<p>When the buyer&#x27;s well dries up they go into town to purchase water from someone else. They are paying the same price as everyone else purchasing water during the drought.<p>&gt; You are expected to sell water on credit and track and collect from buyers every month (billing) but the buyer doesn&#x27;t believe that he should have to pay for that for that because you have to do it anyway. Sometimes you don&#x27;t get paid but the buyer wants to be guaranteed he will be paid even when you don&#x27;t get paid (credit risk).<p>The buyer does sell their water on credit, but to only one customer: you. They accept the credit risk that they may not be paid, but the odds of the water salesman defaulting are much lower than a random water buyer. Should you go under, the credits you gave them to their account become worthless.<p>&gt; Your suppliers are being mandated to reduce the amount of waters being pulled from aquifers (fossil fuels) and are saying that the cost of water during droughts will likely rise over the next 20 years. In addition we&#x27;ll likely see more floods and expect that prices of water during a flood may go negative so you expect based on his habits that your buyer will lose you more money then in the past.<p>Your buyer provides you with a source of water that doesn&#x27;t come from the aquifers, and you&#x27;re the one who hasn&#x27;t invested in any way to store water from the flood<p>&gt; The trucks you use to move water around are old and have caused accidents due to poor maintenance (fires) and need to be replaced with more expensive models (buried cable). Nobody wants you to build warehouses since the 50&#x27;s (hydro) because they are ugly and all good land for warehouse has been used but you are running out of warehouse space. This is leading to scenarios where entire communities haven&#x27;t been able to get water and people have died.<p>Luckily since there are more sources of water and they are closer to the buyers, the water trucks don&#x27;t have to be driven as far, and don&#x27;t need to carry as much water.<p>&gt; The relationship with this buyer is massively one-sided and a money losing proposition. You have been sued because of the accidents and have gone into bankruptcy. Your buyer is a middle-class home owner and when you talk to him about the challenges he doesn&#x27;t want the relationship to change and he expects that he won&#x27;t pay more over the next 20 years. Costs for other buyers have roughly doubled in the last 10 years and are on average poorer then your homeowner.<p>The relationship with the buyer is indeed massively one sided. You determine the water prices, they can only sell to you, the can only sell water in exchange for the possibility of purchasing water in the future, you can afford as many lawyers as you like, the king has decreed that you are entitled to a guaranteed profit on your water, and no matter what you do the people need a water supply so you will not be allowed to fail. If the water buyer with his little well has to pay the same rising prices as everyone else for the water he purchases, and if he doesn&#x27;t like it he can die in the desert.",jjk166,2022-01-18 22:46:48+00:00,comment

It helps if before there is a problem you accuse them of mental instability and create a culture of bias and ostracism and lighten their workload. Prevent them from participating in any way with the running of the company. Send them on wild goose chases. Assign them things that do very little and will never see the light of day. This has the double effect of giving them more time to worry about the immense workload that is being neglected and making them look useless. If they weren't crazy before they sure will be in a few months when the pressure to meet deadlines builds and they are unable to do anything about it.,goodchild,2013-01-08 19:56:34+00:00,comment

"<i>The group accuses senior officials within the inspector general’s office – including those with the general counsel’s office – of attempting to water down or change findings in whistleblower investigations because of fear of political controversy.</i><p>It&#x27;s a little hard to tell without a close reading of the article, but the <i>alleged</i> destruction of evidence was done by the Office of Special Counsel and unspecified inspectors general offices, not Thomas Drake or his lawyers. That is, the people in charge of whistleblowing cases did the evidence destruction, probably in response to bad PR.<p>This is infuriating on several levels.

"Utility regulation in the U.S. is steeped in New Deal ideas from back when we didn&#x27;t understand how economics worked. Did you know that in the New Deal era, competition was considered a bad thing, so companies had to get permission from the government before building new infrastructure because it might create competition? There&#x27;s still tons of that in the Communications Act. For example, 47 U.S.C. 214.<p>What&#x27;s really telling is that while many in the U.S. want more utility-style regulation, Europe is actively getting away from it. For example, our universal service cross-subsidy system is an antediluvian throwback compared to Sweden (tax credit of about $600 for rural folks to build their own fiber).<p>If you built airplanes the way U.S. municipal entities regulate utilities, government officials would just declare the acceleration of gravity to be 2.5 m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s and pat themselves on the back for basically having solved the problem. Not only do municipal-level regulators not really understand the underlying economics of the system, but they don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re dealing with an economic system. They don&#x27;t understand that the economy that cannot simply be moved a desired end state by legislative fiat, but rather takes legislation as an input into an economic process that produces an equilibrium state that might include many unintended consequences, and may not include the desired end state at all. This is a problem with regulators generally, but is particularly a problem in the U.S. In Europe, things like telecom regulation are handled at the national level by the most sophisticated regulators and economists. In the U.S., most important telecom decisions are made by generalist municipal bodies, who have little understanding of these issues.",rayiner,2018-07-28 04:03:50+00:00,comment

"I was about to suggest you could do this easily in Ruby, but it turns out that getting a catch-all method_missing at the top level to work is quite annoying - too many things in both Irb and Pry (the two main Ruby REPLs) seem to rely on trying method calls and catching the exceptions in ways that broke horribly with my most naive attempts.<p>But something like this works of-sorts in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    module Sh
      def method_missing sym, *args
         bin = ENV[&quot;PATH&quot;].split(&quot;:&quot;).collect do |path|
           full = File.join(path,sym.to_s)
           File.exists?(full) ? full : nil
         end.compact[0] rescue nil

         if !bin
           raise NameError.new(sym.to_s)
         else
           bin = system(bin,*args.collect{|a| a.to_s})
         end
       end
    end

    self.extend Sh
</code></pre>
Pry can&#x27;t handle it very well, probably as it relies extensively on method_missing &quot;magic&quot; itself, but Irb seems do do fine with it.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are ways to do the above in much cleaner ways, and even in Ruby syntax still gets in the way. E.g. you need to do &#x27;ps :aux&#x27; or &#x27;ps &quot;aux&quot;&#x27; instead of &quot;ps aux&quot; or the options will get interpreted as a method (though you <i>could</i> conceivably try to handle that by capturing NameError exceptions and applying really horribly nasty hacks, there would be a special place in hell for you if you were to do that; even the above is likely to break all kinds of stuff).<p>&gt; And what if the shell output wasn&#x27;t line-oriented but a live hypertext doc, say HTML5?<p>There have been all kinds of attempts at that, notably XmlTerm from Mozilla ca. 2000 [1].

"&gt; 2x scale displays certainly make East Asian text readable, but rendering 2x and downscaling to 1.5x will do a lot of damage to the legibility. It’s far from ideal.<p>I&#x27;m typing this on a MacBook with scaled display and legibility is just fine. Asian scripts look fine, too. iPhones also use a scaled output (most recent models all do, there&#x27;s no match between physical pixel and GPU pixel at all anymore on OLED, and there&#x27;s no match between GPU and logical pixel either). You&#x27;ll never hear customers in Japan or China complain about poor legibility.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between theory and practice. If you try it, you realize there&#x27;s no problem.

"Quoting one publication about MISRA [1]:<p>&quot;From the data obtained, we can make the following key observations. First, there are 9 out of 72 rules for which violations were observed that perform significantly better (α = 0.05) than a random predictor at locating fault-related lines. The true positive rates for these rules range from 24-100%. Second, we observed a negative correlation between MISRA rule violations and observed faults. In addition, 29 out of 72 rules had a zero true positive rate. Taken together with Adams&#x27; observation that all modifications have a non-zero probability of introducing a fault, this makes it possible that adherence to the MISRA standard as a whole would have made the software less reliable.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.tudelft.nl&#x2F;islandora&#x2F;object&#x2F;uuid:646de5ba-eee8-4ec8-8bbc-2c188e1847ea?collection=research"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.tudelft.nl&#x2F;islandora&#x2F;object&#x2F;uuid:646de5ba...</a>",Hirrolot,2022-06-03 15:44:14+00:00,comment

"A few things that I notice in the area where I&#x27;m somewhat active as an OSM contributor:<p>- You probably shouldn&#x27;t render guideposts or route markers on the map, or at least not with generic &quot;info&quot; icon.<p>- Things with access=private are likely not terribly relevant to people looking at the map. This will include things like parking spots or gardens.<p>- Lots of shots and amenities have icons, but doctors don&#x27;t. Neither do fire stations.<p>- Sports pitches are shown as nodes, but may be better shown as areas, since they often cover quite extensive swaths of ground that&#x27;s otherwise empty with just an icon in the middle. Same with playgrounds, schools, and kindergartens, gardens, and parks.<p>- For buildings and building parts, if you don&#x27;t make use of the parts in any way (such as showing roofs, height, etc.) perhaps just disregard the parts and only render the building outlines. This, combined with the fact that geometries seem to be simplified, even at the highest zoom levels, results in a bit of a mess of lines at times where some outlines are simplified differently from others that <i>should</i> actually share parts of the same edges and thus overlap perfectly. (e.g. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Avenue%3Away%2F111206435"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Avenue%3Away%2F11120...</a> or <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Avenue%3Away%2F111206435"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Avenue%3Away%2F11120...</a>). Same thing with the geometry simplification also happens with adjacent geometry that should actually not have gaps (e.g. semidetached houses or garages next to houses). Lots of buildings that are actually rectangular also get quite weird angles.<p>- Tunnels are quite subtle. And while at least roads in tunnels don&#x27;t overlap buildings that are actually above them (like with Carto) it&#x27;s still hard to make out what&#x27;s above and what&#x27;s below in such cases (e.g. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Astreet%3Apolyline%3A30081121"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.earth&#x2F;place&#x2F;openstreetmap%3Astreet%3Apolyline%3...</a>). Culverts for waterways are handled better than roads in tunnels in this case.<p>Overall though, this seems like a quite nice map style. Closer to Google Maps in that it emphasizes roads, but some people like the less detailed look (and it works better with vector maps, I guess, to have fewer polygons to render).",ygra,2022-08-23 12:43:25+00:00,comment

"It is indeed amazing, but the answer can be simpler. Without pain, there is no such thing as not pain. You need to feel what pain is, so that you know what it feels like to not have pain.<p>If we all were in some sort of utopia, or heaven, we would be dead bored. Life is good because we keep learning and in pain there is much learning which is different from the learning one acquires when not in pain. If there was only one state of being, there would not be many opportunities for growth. In life however there are many states of being between absolute pain and absolute not pain which gives one so much room for growth and learning and also variety for everyone to be unique in their own way.<p>Once one stops learning however, everything is familiar, and eventually, boring. Which is why the concept of heaven or hell is attractive at first, but only because we are not in heaven or hell. It is like buying those gorgeous trousers you wanted, or car, which eventually becomes just a pair of trousers or just a car.

"OVH is a very large dedicated hosting company. They now have a nice location in North America (Montreal) as well, with tremendous prices. They generally get solid reviews. If I had to peg them, it&#x27;d be a B rating or 8 out of 10. Weak customer service, but you can pay a modest fee and get immediate attention. Their hardware is solid.<p>Whether you use them or not is probably down to three issues: do you need managed servers and rapid response from a tech inside the company; if you need US based hosting, they don&#x27;t offer that, but the Montreal location gets great speeds to most of the US; the listed kimsufi servers are obviously located in Europe.",adventured,2013-07-25 17:32:48+00:00,comment

"I have had quite a bit of experience with this.<p>I&#x27;m primarily a native Apple application developer, but have done some backend stuff, as well. I have designed numerous Web sites, but I am not a particularly skilled Web designer.<p>I was, in the days of yore, an artist. I have also taken numerous design and usability courses, from the likes of NNG (Nielsen-Norman Group).<p>I&#x27;m a passable graphic designer, but don&#x27;t pretend to be anywhere near &quot;pro&quot; level. I know enough to be dangerous (and use many of the tools).<p>I have designed a bunch of fancy widgets[0 - 4]. I actually use very few of them, because they are too intrusive.<p>I am in the &quot;refining UX&quot; stage of an iOS app that I&#x27;ve been developing for the last year and a half, or so. I&#x27;m working with designers and testers, to clean up the information architecture, interaction, usability, aesthetic design, and accessibility.<p>For me, the most valuable technique, has been rapid, high-quality prototyping. I have been abusing Apple&#x27;s TestFlight[5] beta release system, and have been using it to make regular (usually, a couple a day) releases to the rest of the team, who are mostly non-tech people. I&#x27;ve made over 600 releases. The first release was made less than a month after first code submission.<p>The way I use it, is that I run what I call &quot;constant beta.&quot; The app is <i>always</i> at &quot;ship&quot; Quality, even if incomplete. This means that the code people get, is fully operational, for the currently developed feature set, and they aren&#x27;t using some kind of &quot;lash-up&quot; kludgy throwaway code. They are working with the actual code that will ship.<p>This has the advantage of constant vetting by Apple. They don&#x27;t test TestFlight to the same level as the App Store, but they look for things like unsupported API usage, code signing issues, and obvious quality issues (like crashes). In at least one case, their testing found a crash that I missed.<p>Once the first release for a version has been vetted (takes a day or so), subsequent build releases, within that version, are approved almost immediately, so I get quick turnaround.<p>If the testers encounter crashes, I get a fairly useless report. If I use a Ouija board, I can often figure out the general part of the application affected.<p>With this workflow, we can have a <i>highly</i> iterative process, with aesthetics, usability, and general UX, being tested, almost from the start.<p>It also means that integration testing (the most important kind), starts almost immediately, and continues, throughout the development lifecycle.<p>It also means that I throw away a lot of good code. Most of those widgets I referenced were once in the app, and we decided not to use them, so I broke them into open-source packages, for reuse in future projects (I tend to eat my own dog food. I have a lot of packages in the app).<p>I&#x27;m pretty good at interpreting designs. I can accept Figma, Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, Napkin Sketch, or Hand-Wavy Verbal Description, and turn it into UX. I usually have something for the designers to try out, within minutes.<p>Most of the actual app assets are generated (and stored in the app) as vector PDF, via Illustrator, and I will often redesign raster art, into vector.<p>The designers and non-tech stakeholders seem to like it.<p>WFM. YMMV.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_Spinner"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_Spinner</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_MaskButton"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_MaskButton</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_Checkbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_Checkbox</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_RetroLEDDisplay"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_RetroLEDDisplay</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_AutofillTextField"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_AutofillTextField</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;testflight&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;testflight&#x2F;</a>",ChrisMarshallNY,2022-07-19 15:44:14+00:00,comment

"Power is different, people are using these movements to wield power, not necessarily to harm others.<p>Someone with power is going to harm others (for some definition of harm) because wielding power generally means giving someone something and that implies not giving it to someone else.

"If someone has a desire for or the capability to enjoy sex with both males and females, they are neither heterosexual, nor homosexual. They also do not change their sexuality. They are simply bisexual. The fluidity here lies in whether someone has at some point in time more interest in women or men and which desire they act upon. If one&#x27;s interest in one of the sexes goes to zero, then one could argue that persons sexuality did indeed change from bisexual to hetero- or homo-sexual.<p>Bisexuals indeed have the unique opportunity to &quot;decide&quot; which side of their sexuality they pursue, because they enjoy both. That&#x27;s what makes them different from &quot;true&quot; heterosexuals and homosexuals who can not enjoy both.

"I think what is upsetting to those who create free[0] software, particularly GPLed works, is that their code has been used to create something that is non-free, which they have no control over (and thus takes away all the 4 freedoms).<p>As such I really don&#x27;t understand why so many people are saying things like you have said here. These people believing in free software, including the original intent of the GPL to be a tool against copyright, does not mean they should, or would, be all for co-pilot, a non-free product by a company that once spat in the face of free software (and likely still does behind closed doors), who is using their free software, including the GPLed works, to create a non-free software.<p>As such, even if it ends up being legal from a license standpoint, it really feels like copyleft is being taken advantage of and exploited because nothing is given back in return (even if copilot remained free of charge, that&#x27;s hardly giving back in foss lingo). So I suppose it&#x27;s more a moral and intent thing rather than a legal thing at this point, unless copyright law decides copilot is a derivative work (doubtful, personally).<p>&gt; Unless my recollection is off, the GPL was never the goal of the original Free Software movement; it was merely a tool to get to the end state where all code becomes available for use by anyone for any reason without cost or restriction.<p>Yes, but the GPL was created for a world with copyright to step towards a world without it. However we are extremely far away from such a world, and I don&#x27;t see how copilot helps step towards it at all. I just don&#x27;t see the argument. It just results in code that will be used potentially wrongly in copyrighted works, proprietary or not. And all of this is enabled by, as I mentioned, a non-free software created by <i>Microsoft</i>, who have used their huge capital to gain access to a proprietary AI by throwing money at it. Nothing about it seems fair even if it ends up all being legal in copyright terms.<p>[0] I&#x27;m seeing a lot of people in these threads who don&#x27;t know the definition of free software or open source.

"&gt; use the massively diversified risk pool<p>Diversified risk doesn&#x27;t reduce average costs, it only averages the cost across everybody. Doing this generally <i>raises</i> average costs significantly by making people insensitive to price, resulting in over-consumption, i.e. unnecessary tests and procedures. We already have this problem with employer-provided coverage, but covering more stuff makes it worse.<p>&gt; plus minuscule administrative costs (compared to private insurance)<p>Most of the administrative cost of private insurance is related to investigating insurance fraud. Doctors and patients can still collude to claim procedures were done without actually doing them and then keep the money, so somebody still has to do that. Putting it in the police budget instead of the Medicare budget is an accounting difference. It doesn&#x27;t actually save the money.<p>Also, the administrative costs of private insurance are only a small percentage of overall healthcare costs.<p>&gt; price negotiation power<p>Passing a law that everybody has to pay taxes for an insurance program which then out-competes private insurance by having a taxpayer subsidy and becomes a monopsony is not &quot;negotiating&quot; prices. It&#x27;s price controls. It allows Medicare to set whatever price they want because the provider&#x27;s alternative is having no patients.<p>They can absolutely dictate lower prices that way, but then more providers go out of business. It&#x27;s less profitable to make new drugs and new medical devices, so fewer companies do and we get fewer new drugs and new medical devices.

"In my experience, Haskell&#x27;s comparatively complex and - arguably - also rather <i>ad hoc</i> type system can make a discussion of monads quite involved and hard to follow.<p>For those who approach Haskell with some Prolog or Mercury background, it may be useful to know that Prolog&#x27;s Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) are very similar to monads. In Prolog, a DCG clause of the form<p><pre><code>    head --&gt;
        goal_1,
        goal_2,
        ...,
        goal_n.
</code></pre>
is implicitly augmented with 2 additional arguments that are <i>threaded through</i> as follows:<p><pre><code>    head(S0, S) --&gt;
        goal_1(S0, S1),
        goal_2(S1, S2),
        ...,
        goal_n(S_(n-1), S).
</code></pre>
It is in these 2 arguments that you can <i>implicitly</i> pass around additional information such as counters, list differences, &quot;global&quot; variables, and states in general. Prolog provides dedicated syntax (called <i>semicontext notation</i>) to access these implicit arguments if needed. Often, they are simply threaded through implicitly throughout large portions of code without any modification.<p>Thus, it is obvious that DCGs, and hence monads, can save a lot of typing that would arise if you had to pass around these arguments explicitly. Also, they let you focus on the <i>essence</i> by making data that is only relevant to a small set of predicates (or functions) <i>implicit</i> in your programs.<p>It may be easier to understand these concepts if you can discuss them in isolation from a type system.",triska,2018-05-06 20:00:48+00:00,comment

"&#62; <i>I don't understand where the fixation for multiple founders stems from</i><p>Basically the YC model stems from PG recreating his experience with ViaWeb.  He started a company with his
best friend and another expert programmer, so that's the model that seems like the ""right"" model to them.<p>Others have very different experiences working with other people (e.g. the much-maligned <i>group projects</i> in
college) so they have a different mental model of what works and what doesn't, at least for themselves.<p>There are extremely valid arguments both ways which largely boil down to individual variation, but here's a
key point that gets overlooked:  Perhaps if you haven't done it as a single founder, you don't know what it
takes, and so you don't know what to look for.<p>He <i>has</i> done it in a group.  So if you're good at picking twos and threes, or feel you are, you can fill up
your whole complement with those.<p>And then it becomes self-reinforcing.  You get more and more confident with the one than the other which is
avoided.  Some pitchers rely on their fastball and don't develop their slider.<p>So eventually you're looking at, let's say for sake of illustration, 90% confidence in picking groups, but
hardly any confidence still in picking solo founders.<p>So when you're looking at the last slot, do you want to add another group you are 90% sure of, or say no to
someone you are excited about and go with some solo founder you are dubious about?  And what about the
second-to-last slot?  And all the way back...  Surely your FIRST choice isn't going to be a solo founder!<p>Even though YC claims not to have a fixed limit, obviously there is a practical limit.  And when they say
they fund everyone they find promising, you have to take it with a grain of salt, because in their model,
being a single founder already isn't promising.",seven_stones,2011-10-19 08:47:56+00:00,comment
"I have been on SO for over 10 years (not a community moderator; just have the standard moderation powers auto-enabled based on 25k+ rep). I have seen many community moderators who are extremely disrespectful to helpful users, and exhibit the degree of zealous devotion to some abstract rules that would make Chairman Mao smile. My weak attempts to prevent them from bullying users have utterly failed.<p>It&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve. SO could simply let community moderators vote out the jerks from among them. That would work great, if only the vast majority of community moderators were kind, considerate, thoughtful people. However, just like with certain other professions, the moderator role tends to appeal either to super-altruists, or to power hungry fanatics. Sadly, the world has a lot more of the latter than the former.<p>And even more so than with reddit (where at least there&#x27;s some competition between different communitiies), there&#x27;s only one SO. Also, the intrinsic importance of historical content on SO is a huge barrier to any competiition. So it&#x27;s not like users can vote with their feet.<p>So even if SO management wanted to fix the problem, what could they do?

"<i>&gt; It wasn&#x27;t until Celera started embarrassing the NIH effort that shotgun sequencing was taken up in earnest.</i><p>Sure.<p>But I disagree with the overall premise and think you&#x27;re over-simplifying in the extreme. What really made the Human Genome Project possible was the Moore-like curve in sequencing throughput that occurred throughout the lifetime of the Human Genome Project. There were <i>many</i> contributing factors that kept the curve going (including the other Moore curve!)<p>Also, Sangar never got a Nobel in Medicine (just in Chemistry). So even if shotgun sequencing is the idea that deserves the Nobel for Human Genome Project -- which again, isn&#x27;t exactly an incontestable assertion -- then it&#x27;s Sangar, not Venter, who was robbed. Awarding Venter with a <i>scientific</i> award for his <i>political</i> work pushing Sangar&#x27;s science would be an odd choice, not to mention at odds with your apparent overall feelings about the role of politics in Nobel awards.<p>Which... maybe they both deserve a Nobel for their contributions to the Genome Project. Probably so, in my opinion. It&#x27;s almost like the supply of Nobels is artificially constrained and not everyone who deserves one can get one...<p><i>&gt; Later, his idea of then taking shotgun sequencing and applying it to whatever DNA you could find floating in the Sargasso Sea or any random teaspoon of dirt literally opened a whole new world of evolutionary biology.</i><p>Lots of people use shotgun sequencing for all sorts of high-profile and important stuff that is literally opening a whole new world of all sorts of important fields.<p>And there&#x27;s a lot of stuff going on outside of genetic sequencing that also deserves Nobels.<p><i>&gt; Finally, his more recent work on creating a fully synthetic organism is continuing to push forward the bleeding edge of biotechnology by laying a foundation all of humanity is sure to build on for decades to come.</i><p>So maybe a Nobel will be awarded in the decades to come. Nobels are given for impact, not promise, and impact takes decades to accrue even for the most impactful work.<p>I would never say someone like Venter &quot;doesn&#x27;t deserve a Nobel&quot;. But getting all bent out of shape that he doesn&#x27;t have one is kinda weird, especially since he&#x27;s not exactly starved of other sources of recognition -- both inside and outside Academia -- for his contributions. Lots of people who played outsized roles in the Human Genome Project exist in relative obscurity relative to Venter.

"Zindagi in Hindi&#x2F;Urdu means Life.<p>This library was on my mind since a while when I started obsessing over Game of life patterns and got introduced to the broader world of cellular automata.

"You know, I get the point you are making, and there is some truth to it. But overblown statements like &quot;academia is just not about science these days&quot; totally undermine the rest of your argument. It&#x27;s unfortunate that you had a bad experience, but extrapolating that to an indictment of _all of science_ seems like sour grapes. A lot of people, the majority, are doing good work. It&#x27;s not the caricature you make it out to be.",hyperbovine,2017-10-29 20:24:43+00:00,comment

"The point is simply standard economic law analysis - the idea is to make (punishment * probability of being caught) &gt; expected gain from the crime. The theory is that if you remove the incentive for the behavior you wish to discourage, people will cut out.<p>There are many criticisms of the approach, but those are mostly about crimes committed by individuals, not corporations. When you&#x27;re talking about HugeCo abusing customers, I think seriously punitive fines can work. But you need to make them painful enough that at least the board, and preferably the shareholders, want to ask questions about how exactly they know this won&#x27;t happen again.<p>&gt; I think the endgame from such a punishment regime is companies will reorganize their corporate structure to section everything off from such liabilities.<p>Of course they will. Any time a corporate entity can construct legal structures to capture more, shed externalities or shift risk, it will. Why wouldn&#x27;t it? &quot;We have a legal obligation to maximize profit...&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s not the &quot;endgame of such a regime&quot;, that&#x27;s normal business.",_jal,2020-02-29 02:18:58+00:00,comment
