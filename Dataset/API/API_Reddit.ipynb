      "As the entire comment chain demonstrates, most people don't know what a yield sign is.  You are supposed to yield to people entering your lane, it's so that people can enter/exit highways/ major roadways in an orderly fashion.  Incoming traffic yields to exiting traffic, boom.  You are not supposed to merge from a ramp lane onto a main road the way this cop is attempting.\n",

      "You’re correct. It’s a merge lane, but it has its own lane you’re supposed to zipper merge with. People always stop at these in America even if the lane goes on forever and there’s a solid white line. There’s one where I live at, that people will stop at to wait for all of the traffic and hop across 3 lanes with solid white lines just to turn left at the next light.\n",

And the worst part is, on the opposite side of the highway the same condition exists, but with no yield sign, and people stop because, hey, it's like that on the other side.  Drives me nuts.\n",
      "The lane ends in 10 feet so you have to merge. You have to yield to existing straight traffic and don't just get your own spot to exist. It's the same premise as a roundabout but people are inconsiderate as fuck and close gaps and leave no space and forces stops.\n",
      "The lane ends shortly afterwards. Legally you're supposed to ensure that you can safely merge with traffic before you go past the yield sign. Some people just like to play chicken and force someone in the traffic with the green light to hit their brakes to let them in.\n",
      "If it's a merge lane, and you see no room to merge, it would be more dangerous to fill it up, and then stop at the end. Then you'd be forced to accelerate quickly once a spot opens. The cop seems to be waiting for a spot instead of just flooring it without looking.\n",

It’s true that there is a yield sign, but a huge, huge percentage of us would just continue along the short merge lane and carefully zipper into traffic. I can see plenty of big gaps in the video where a combination of movement and a blinker would have made it easy to get in. Some people will say the cop is being safe, but plenty of others would describe this as overly cautious. Personally, there’s no way I sit there like the cop - I’ll keep moving, turn on my blinker, and safely squeeze in - no problem. Notice how the filmer immediately pulls right out?

There is no need to stop anywhere when you have a merging lane if everyone is driving carefully. If you get to the end of the merging lane and you could not merge, then the traffic is either blocked or really slow so there is no need to carelessly force your way in.
