jhartmggc,Its tragic how this all unfolded Unfortunately once the officers suspected a DIU they had to follow the rules Changing laws for minor crimes like DIU where the car is impounded and the suspect is ticketed and told to report to court instead of being handcuffed and arrested would have avoided this confrontation,0,2020-11-13 10:40:59.345294,316

Darell2710,Yes he made a mistake but there was no reason for the police to shoot him You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting You are supposed to meet the escalation level attempt to deescalate and never to escalate further A taser may have been a threat as seen in the extended version of this video but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm Furthermore shots should be made to disarm and not to kill Shooting and killing this fleeing criminal made the police the judge and the jury on that mans life If they had let him go then the law would still have caught up with him eventually Not all criminals deserve the death penalty,0,2020-11-13 10:40:59.345294,894
